## **Introduction**

This Parenting Plan is a binding agreement created in accordance with South African law, primarily the **Children's Act 38 of 2005** (specifically Sections 33-35). Its purpose is to outline the responsibilities and rights of each parent, ensuring that all decisions are made in the **best interests of the child** as mandated by Section 28 of the **Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996**.

This plan aims to foster a stable, nurturing, and conflict-free environment for the child/children involved, promoting the active participation of both parents in their upbringing.
