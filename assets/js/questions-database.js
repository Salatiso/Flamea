    question: "Who helps make sure we follow rules at home?",
    options: ["The dog", "Your mom or dad", "Your friend", "The TV"],
    answer: "Your mom or dad",
    primary_explanation: "Parents or guardians help enforce rules at home to keep everyone safe and happy.",
    secondary_explanation: "A father's role in setting these rules is essential. In *The Homeschooling Father*, Salatiso describes this as a core duty: providing the moral foundation that protects the family unit from outside chaos (Mdeni, p. 23). This family structure is what Thomas Sowell calls a highly efficient decision-making unit, passing on crucial 'background social capital' that formal institutions cannot replicate (Sowell, *Knowledge and Decisions*, p. 112). Without a father's presence, as Warren Farrell explains in *The Boy Crisis*, boys in particular can suffer from a lack of direction (Farrell, p. 58).",

    secondary_explanation: "Rules are the building blocks of a just society. In *Goliath's Stand*, Salatiso emphasizes standing for firm principles as the basis for a healthy community (Mdeni, p. 88). Thomas Sowell explains in *Basic Economics* that these rules reduce the costs of human interaction by making behavior predictable (p. 45). For boys, as Christina Hoff Sommers notes in *The War Against Boys*, clear rules provide the psychological safety needed to explore the world confidently (p. 150).",

    secondary_explanation: "This simple rule is a life-saving social agreement. In *Beyond Redress*, Salatiso discusses how societies need clear, universally applied standards to function (Mdeni, p. 65). The red light is a perfect example of what Thomas Sowell, in *Knowledge and Decisions*, calls a low-cost, high-value piece of knowledge that coordinates thousands of strangers for mutual benefit (p. 41). The immediate, predictable consequence of breaking this rule (danger) is a clear lesson in cause and effect.",

    secondary_explanation: "Learning to control aggression is a boy's first step toward honorable manhood, a failure central to Salatiso's *Goliath's Reckoning*, where undisciplined emotion leads to devastating outcomes (Mdeni, p. 112). As Steven Pinker shows in *The Better Angels of Our Nature*, a key part of the 'civilizing process' is internalizing rules against impulsive violence (p. 68). The solution isn't to make boys less masculine, but to channel their energy constructively, a point central to *The War Against Boys* by Christina Hoff Sommers (p. 91).",

    answer: "To go to school",
    primary_explanation: "Every kid has the right to learn at school.",
    secondary_explanation: "While the right to attend school is legally protected, *quality* of education is what matters. In *The Homeschooling Father*, Salatiso argues a father's duty is to ensure genuine education, not just state-mandated schooling (Mdeni, p. 45). This is critical because, as Bryan Caplan argues in *The Case Against Education*, much of schooling is a wasteful 'signaling' exercise (p. 103). For boys, this is compounded by a school culture often hostile to their nature, a central point made by Christina Hoff Sommers in *The War Against Boys* (p. 15).",

    secondary_explanation: "However, a government's power must be held in check, a central argument in Salatiso's *Goliath's Stand* (Mdeni, p. 145). Thomas Sowell warns in *Knowledge and Decisions* that the incentives for government decision-makers are often political, not practical (p. 215). When government oversteps into the family domain, as Helen Smith argues in *Men on Strike*, it often weakens the father's authority and creates the very social problems it claims to be solving (p. 45).",

    answer: "Everyone gets what they need",
    primary_explanation: "Fair means making sure everyone is treated equally and kindly.",
    secondary_explanation: "The idea of 'fairness' is complex. In *Fairness of Unfair Discrimination*, Salatiso explores how trying to make outcomes equal can lead to treating people unfairly (Mdeni, p. 19). Thomas Sowell, in *Basic Economics*, distinguishes between 'process fairness' (same rules for all) and 'outcome fairness' (same result for all), arguing only the first is true justice (p. 221).",

    answer: "To keep traffic moving safely",
    primary_explanation: "Traffic lights help cars and people cross roads without accidents.",
    secondary_explanation: "Traffic lights are a simple system of rules that prevent chaos. In *Beyond Redress*, Salatiso highlights the need for such clear, impartial rules (Mdeni, p. 65). Economically, they are a low-cost way to coordinate thousands of people. This is an example of what Thomas Sowell, in *Knowledge and Decisions*, calls 'systemic rationality'—the system works without anyone needing to be in charge (p. 42).",

    answer: "Give it to an adult",
    primary_explanation: "An adult can help find who lost it or decide what to do.",
    secondary_explanation: "This is a basic test of character. In *The Homeschooling Father*, Salatiso shows that teaching integrity is more important than academic subjects (Mdeni, p. 78). This act builds 'social capital,' the trust that makes society work. As Thomas Sowell notes in *Basic Economics*, societies with high levels of trust have lower transaction costs for everything (p. 301).",

    answer: "No",
    primary_explanation: "Lying can make things worse; it's better to tell the truth.",
    secondary_explanation: "Honesty is a core principle of manhood. Salatiso's *Goliath's Reckoning* shows the devastating consequences of lies within the legal system, especially in family court (Mdeni, p. 55). Lies create what economists like Thomas Sowell call 'asymmetric information,' where one person knows the truth and the other doesn't, leading to bad decisions (*Basic Economics*, p. 150).",

    primary_explanation: "Stopping when someone says 'stop' shows respect and keeps everyone safe.",
    secondary_explanation: "Recognizing boundaries is fundamental to healthy relationships. The failure to teach this is a catastrophe, a theme Christina Hoff Sommers explores in *The War Against Boys* (p. 121). In a legal context, as seen in Salatiso's *Goliath's Reckoning*, ignoring boundaries can have life-altering consequences (Mdeni, p. 98). This rule is the first step in learning the self-control which Steven Pinker identifies as a key driver of the decline in violence (*The Better Angels of Our Nature*, p. 115).",

    primary_explanation: "Taking something without asking isn’t fair; always ask first!",
    secondary_explanation: "This simple rule is the foundation of property rights. In *Beyond the Grave*, Salatiso discusses the importance of respecting what belongs to others (Mdeni, p.41). As Thomas Sowell explains in *Basic Economics*, without property rights, there is no incentive to create or care for anything, leading to poverty and conflict (p. 31). Teaching a child this principle is the first step toward a prosperous and free society.",

    answer: "Your teacher or parent",
    primary_explanation: "Teachers and parents are there to help you when you need it.",
    secondary_explanation: "A child's first line of defense is their family, especially their father. *The Homeschooling Father* by Salatiso is a powerful example of a father stepping in when other systems fail to protect a child (Mdeni, p. 15). The absence of a father is a key predictor of vulnerability, a central point made by Warren Farrell in *The Boy Crisis* (p. 22). Society functions because families, as Thomas Sowell notes, create a 'first resort' for help, reducing the burden on formal institutions (*Knowledge and Decisions*, p. 113).",

    primary_explanation: "Saying 'please' is a polite way to ask for what you want.",
    secondary_explanation: "Politeness reduces social friction. As argued in Salatiso's *Goliath's Stand*, treating people with dignity underpins a functional society (Mdeni, p. 50). Thomas Sowell would describe this as a low-cost convention that helps people coordinate their actions without conflict (*Basic Economics*, p. 46).

    answer: "Yes",
    primary_explanation: "Sharing makes playing more fun and shows kindness.",
    secondary_explanation: "Sharing teaches reciprocity, the foundation of cooperation. As Richard Dawkins explains in *The Selfish Gene*, reciprocal altruism can be a winning evolutionary strategy (p. 187). In *The Homeschooling Father*, Salatiso shows that teaching children to share builds strong family bonds (Mdeni, p. 92). Economically, as Thomas Sowell notes, this is the basis of trade, which creates wealth for everyone involved (*Basic Economics*, p. 11).",

    answer: "Help them",
    primary_explanation: "Helping someone who’s sad is a kind thing to do.",
    secondary_explanation: "This is a question of empathy. In *Goliath's Stand*, Salatiso emphasizes compassion as a pillar of moral education (Mdeni, p. 115). Steven Pinker argues in *The Better Angels of Our Nature* that an expanding circle of empathy is a major force that has made the world less violent (p. 692). Christina Hoff Sommers warns in *The War Against Boys* that empathy must be balanced with teaching boys resilience and strength (p. 180).",

    answer: "To stay safe",
    primary_explanation: "Seatbelts keep you safe if the car stops suddenly.",
    secondary_explanation: "A seatbelt is a simple, low-cost tool that dramatically reduces the cost of a mistake. As Salatiso advocates in *The Homeschooling Father*, a father's primary role is protection, and teaching this is a basic act of that protection (Mdeni, p. 24). Thomas Sowell, in *Knowledge and Decisions*, would call this risk management: a simple rule that prevents a catastrophic outcome (p. 89).",

    answer: "Saying you’ll do something",
    primary_explanation: "A promise is when you say you’ll do something and mean it.",
    secondary_explanation: "A promise is a verbal contract, and a man's honor depends on keeping his word. The failure of the justice system to keep its promise of fairness is a central theme of Salatiso's *Goliath's Reckoning* (Mdeni, p. 201). A promise builds trust, which Thomas Sowell identifies as essential 'social capital' (*Basic Economics*, p. 301). The decline of marriage, as detailed by Helen Smith in *Men on Strike*, is partly a story of the state breaking the marriage contract (p. 48).",

    secondary_explanation: "Saying 'thank you' reinforces positive behavior and encourages future cooperation. This simple act is a key part of the moral education Salatiso describes in *The Homeschooling Father* (Mdeni, p. 93).

    secondary_explanation: "Taking responsibility for your actions is the cornerstone of maturity. A central theme of Salatiso's *Beyond Redress* is that individuals, not groups, are responsible for their choices (Mdeni, p. 110).

    secondary_explanation: "While the Constitution is supposed to protect rights, its interpretation by courts is what matters. In *Fairness of Unfair Discrimination*, Salatiso shows how these rights can be twisted (Mdeni, p. 19).

    primary_explanation: "The right to education means every kid gets a chance to learn at school.",
    secondary_explanation: "The 'right to education' often means attending a school that may not be suitable, especially for boys. *The Homeschooling Father* by Salatiso is a powerful argument for educational freedom (Mdeni, p. 35). As Bryan Caplan's *The Case Against Education* suggests, much of this 'right' is about social signaling, not genuine learning (p. 264), in a system often hostile to boys, as Christina Hoff Sommers documents in *The War Against Boys* (p. 65).",

    answer: "Everyone is treated fairly",
    primary_explanation: "Equality means no one is discriminated against because of who they are.",
    secondary_explanation: "The ideal of 'equality' is often corrupted. Salatiso's *Fairness of Unfair Discrimination* demonstrates how policies aiming for group equality result in unfairness to individuals (Mdeni, p. 19). Thomas Sowell calls this the pursuit of 'cosmic justice,' which ignores real-world variables to enforce a pre-conceived notion of fairness, often with disastrous results (*Knowledge and Decisions*, p. 240).

    primary_explanation: "Many South Africans, including politicians and experts, worked together to make the Constitution.",
    secondary_explanation: "While many were involved, the key question is what knowledge guided them. Salatiso critiques the outcomes of these processes in *Beyond Redress* (Mdeni, p. 88).

    secondary_explanation: "The definition of 'human rights' has expanded with negative consequences. In *Beyond Redress*, Salatiso argues that when rights are defined as claims on resources provided by others, it leads to government overreach (Mdeni, p. 150).

    secondary_explanation: "Yes, but the most important right a child has is the right to a stable, loving family with their father. Salatiso's *Goliath's Reckoning* shows how the legal system, in the name of 'children's rights,' often violates this primary right by removing fathers (Mdeni, p. 34).

As Bryan Caplan argues in *The Case Against Education*, for many, school is a waste of time (p. 1).
