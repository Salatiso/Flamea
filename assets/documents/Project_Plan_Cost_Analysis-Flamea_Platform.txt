Budget ~R500 - R1,500 / month depending on traffic and data storage.Gemini API Costs: Dependent on usage, but budget an initial R500 / month.Post-Launch Maintenance Retainer (Optional but Recommended):Agency: ~R15,000 - R25,000 / monthFreelancer: ~R5,000 - R10,000 / monthPart 5: Conclusion & RecommendationBringing the Flamea vision to life is a significant but achievable investment.The South African Agency offers the highest level of service, communication, and accountability but at a premium price.The International Agency provides a good balance of cost and structured development, but may have time zone and communication challenges.Hiring Freelancers is the most cost-effective option but requires the most hands-on management from you, the client, to coordinate the team.Given the complexity and importance of this project, I would recommend starting with a detailed discovery phase with your chosen provider to refine the scope and get a fixed-price quote. Your role as the content expert is invaluable and saves significant costs that would otherwise be spent on content creation and legal research.
