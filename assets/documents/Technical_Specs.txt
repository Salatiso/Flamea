Flamea.org - Technical SpecificationsDocument Version: 2.0Date: 2025-06-09Project Lead: Salatiso (salatiso.com)AI Development Partner: Gemini1. Core ArchitectureProject Type: Static Website with Dynamic Functionality.Hosting: Deployed on Namecheap (Stellar Plus). The site consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.Core Principle: The site is built "frontend-first." All user-facing rendering and logic happens in the user's browser (client-side). This makes the site fast, responsive, and easy to deploy.2. Frontend TechnologiesStructure (HTML5): All pages are built using semantic HTML5 for accessibility and search engine optimization.Styling (Tailwind CSS): The primary styling framework is Tailwind CSS, loaded via a CDN link in the <head> of each HTML file. This provides a utility-first approach for rapid and consistent design. A supplementary style.css file is used for more complex custom styles.Client-Side Logic (JavaScript - ES6 Modules): All interactivity is powered by modern JavaScript (ECMAScript 6). Scripts are loaded as type="module" to allow for a clean, organized, and import/export-based architecture.3. Backend & Database (BaaS)Provider: Google Firebase.Authentication: Firebase Authentication is used to manage all user accounts (Email/Password and Google Sign-In). This provides a secure and scalable solution for user management.Database: Cloud Firestore (a NoSQL database) is used as the primary database. All user-generated data (profiles, activities, to-dos, skills, saved documents) is stored securely in Firestore, with data structured under each user's unique UID.File Storage: Firebase Storage is used for securely uploading and storing user documents (e.g., in the Document Cabinet).4. External APIs & LibrariesAI Chatbot: Powered by the Google Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash) for real-time generative AI responses.Visual Charts: The Chart.js library is used for creating the visual dashboards (e.g., Profile Completeness).Icons: Font Awesome is used for the icon library across the site.Fonts: Google Fonts is used to load the 'Roboto' and 'Open Sans' font families.5. Version Control & DeploymentVersion Control: Git, managed via GitHub Desktop.Deployment Workflow: Local development in VS Code -> Commit changes using GitHub Desktop -> Manually upload updated files to Namecheap hosting via cPanel or FTP.End of Document
