Part 1: The Evolution of Occupational Health and Safety.


Journey through the Evolution of Occupational Health and Safety in South Africa: From Indigenous Practices to AI Integration.
The concept of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) is not a recent invention. As long we have lived we’ve had to work, and as humans have worked, we have sought ways to manage risks. This section delves into the fascinating history of OHS, exploring its early roots, indigenous perspectives, the influence of colonisation and industrialization, the fight for worker rights, and the milestones that have shaped the current landscape. We will also examine ongoing challenges and exciting advancements that promise a future of safer and healthier workplaces for all.


Early Safeguarding Measures: The concept of occupational health and safety (OHS) has roots in humanity's earliest efforts to manage risks associated with various labourers. Ancient civilizations implemented rudimentary safeguards. Greek physician Hippocrates documented health risks of miners and metalworkers exposed to lead. Roman engineer Vitruvius advocated for ventilation systems in mines to address noxious gases.

Indigenous Knowledge and Practices: South Africa's indigenous populations had their own safety practices. Khoisan hunters emphasised physical fitness and injury prevention through training. Their knowledge of plants and animals helped them understand potential health risks and remedies. Bantu agriculturalists and pastoralists used rotational labour and assigned tasks based on abilities to mitigate risks of strenuous work. Their knowledge of medicinal plants aided in managing injuries and illnesses.

Colonisation and Industrialization's Impact: Colonialism shattered indigenous safety practices in South Africa.  Focus on rapid resource extraction in mines and factories prioritised production over worker safety. This harsh reality spurred regulations and a dedicated OHS workforce. The Industrial Revolution mirrored these issues globally. While Europe focused on child labour, South Africa took its first steps in the 1900s with the Mines and Works Act (1911). This introduced mine inspectors and "safety officers," the early OHS professionals. The fight for better working conditions and a stronger OHS framework continued during, into the post-Apartheid era.

The Fight for Worker Rights: During apartheid, South Africa's mining industry was notorious for its poor working conditions and high accident rates, especially impacting black workers. Legislation like the Miners' Phthisis Act of 1916 and the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act of 1973 aimed to address these issues, but enforcement was lacking. Labour unions, notably the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) led by Cyril Ramaphosa, emerged as strong advocates for worker rights and better OHS standards. This advocacy, along with the growing recognition of prevention, led to the comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) in 1993, emphasising risk assessment, hazard control, and employee participation in OHS.

Milestones in Occupational Health and Safety: Post-apartheid South Africa saw a revolution in workplace safety. The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) of 1993, along with the Constitution's inclusion of safety rights, laid the legal groundwork. "Responsible Care" linked safety to environmental well-being, while the National Institute for Occupational Health (NIOH) provided research and training. Quality management principles like ISO standards were integrated, and the Mine Health and Safety Act addressed the mining industry's specific needs. These advancements created a holistic approach to worker well-being in South Africa.

Challenges and Considerations: Despite progress, challenges remain. The legacy of neglect and high unemployment rates means many work in informal or hazardous environments with inadequate safety measures and healthcare access. The power imbalance created by unemployment makes workers hesitant to report safety concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges, forcing adaptations to OHS practices. Employers had to implement social distancing, PPE requirements, enhanced sanitation, and remote work where possible. The pandemic highlighted the need for a holistic approach to OHS that considers not just physical safety but also mental and emotional well-being.

The Future of OHS: Technology and Beyond: Technological advancements are impacting OHS. Wearable sensors can monitor worker vitals and detect hazards. Robotics and automation can reduce risks associated with hazardous or physically demanding tasks. AI can analyse data to identify patterns, predict risks, and optimise safety protocols. However, ethical and social considerations arise with these advancements. Issues like data privacy, job displacement due to automation, and potential algorithmic biases need to be addressed to ensure equitable distribution of benefits and avoid creating new occupational hazards.

South Africa's future OHS will be shaped by the interplay of technological innovation, regulatory frameworks, and a deep understanding of the unique socio-economic and cultural context. Balancing technological advancements with addressing unemployment, inequality, and historical injustices is crucial for creating a truly safe and healthy working environment for all South Africans.


Navigating the Landscape of Occupational Health and Safety: Key Concepts and Imperatives.
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) isn't just about following regulations; it's a strategic approach built on core concepts that safeguard lives and foster a culture of safety. 
Here's a roadmap to navigate the key elements of OHS:

Proactive Risk Management: Don't wait for accidents to happen. Systematically identify potential hazards in your workplace, considering factors like work processes, equipment, and the environment. Analyse these risks and prioritise actions to mitigate or eliminate them. Regularly reassess risks as conditions evolve and new technologies are introduced.

Be Prepared for Emergencies: Emergency response planning ensures a swift and effective response to incidents like fires, chemical spills, or natural disasters. Develop clear protocols outlining evacuation routes, assembly points, communication channels, and designated roles for personnel. Regular training and drills are essential for reinforcement and practice.

Learn from Incidents: Accidents and near misses are opportunities to improve. Incident management involves a structured approach to reporting, investigating, and analysing incidents to understand root causes. By implementing corrective and preventive actions, you can prevent similar occurrences and share learnings across the organisation, fostering continuous improvement in OHS practices.

Building a Safety Culture: A strong safety culture requires a shared commitment from everyone, from leadership to frontline staff. Visible leadership commitment, open communication, regular safety training, and employee participation are all crucial in building a Safety Culture.

Collaboration is Key: Effective OHS requires collaboration with various stakeholders. Internally, this involves safety committees, supervisors, and employees working together to develop and implement safety policies. Externally, partner with regulatory bodies, industry associations, safety experts, and even community stakeholders. 

Navigating the Legal Landscape: A complex web of local, national, and international regulations governs OHS. Staying on top of evolving regulations like the OHS Act and international standards like ISO 45001 is crucial. Legal compliance protects your organisation from fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Maintain robust record-keeping to demonstrate compliance during inspections.

Holistic Approach to Employee Well-being: Integrate employee assistance programs, mental health resources, and wellness initiatives into your OHS strategy. Addressing stress management, work-life balance, and ergonomics can contribute to a healthier and more engaged workforce, reducing the risk of accidents and illnesses.

Continuous Improvement and Adaptability: Regularly review and update safety protocols, conduct audits, and seek feedback from employees and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement. Organisations that can adjust their OHS strategies in response to emerging challenges are better positioned to maintain a safe and healthy work environment.

By embracing these core concepts, you can build a robust OHS system that safeguards your employees, fosters a proactive safety culture, and prepares for future challenges. This translates to a healthier, happier workforce, fewer disruptions, and a more successful and sustainable organisation.

Appendix II: A Simplified Guide to Key OHS Legislation in South Africa.
As an aspiring Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) professional in South Africa, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the legal framework that governs this field. The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) of 1993 serves as the cornerstone of this framework, providing a comprehensive set of guidelines and regulations to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of employees in the workplace. However, the OHSA does not operate in isolation; it is complemented by several other key pieces of legislation that address specific aspects of occupational health and safety.
In this section, we will explore the four main acts that form the backbone of South Africa's OHS legal landscape: the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA), the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act (COIDA), the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA), and the National Building Regulations and Building Standards Act (NBRBSA). Each of these acts plays a unique role in promoting and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment, and understanding their interplay is essential for any OHS professional.
The OHSA, with its 50 sections and 23 regulations, serves as the overarching legislation that sets out the general duties of employers and employees in relation to health and safety in the workplace. It covers a wide range of industries and provides a framework for identifying and mitigating risks, reporting incidents, and enforcing compliance. 
The OHSA is supported by the COIDA, which focuses on providing compensation to employees who suffer work-related injuries or diseases. The COIDA ensures that workers are financially protected in case of accidents or illnesses arising from their work, and it works hand-in-hand with the OHSA to create a comprehensive safety net for employees. While the OHSA and COIDA apply to most workplaces in South Africa, certain industries have additional legislation that addresses their specific health and safety challenges. 
The MHSA, with its 106 sections and 23 regulations, is one such example. This act is tailored to the unique risks and hazards associated with the mining industry, which has historically been one of the most dangerous sectors in South Africa. The MHSA sets out specific requirements for mine design, ventilation, and rescue services, among other aspects, to ensure the safety and health of mine workers. It also promotes a tripartite approach to health and safety, involving government, employers, and employees in decision-making and policy development.
Another sector-specific legislation is the NBRBSA, which focuses on the health and safety aspects of buildings. With its 29 sections and 23 regulations, the NBRBSA sets out standards for the design, construction, and maintenance of buildings to ensure they are safe and healthy for occupants. This act is particularly relevant for OHS professionals working in the construction industry or involved in the management of buildings, as it provides a framework for ensuring compliance with building safety regulations.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these acts, exploring their objectives, key provisions, and the penalties for non-compliance. By gaining a thorough understanding of this legal landscape, you will be well-equipped to navigate the complexities of occupational health and safety in South Africa and contribute to creating safer and healthier workplaces for all.
As you embark on your journey to becoming an OHS professional, remember that the knowledge of these acts is not just a legal requirement but also a powerful tool in your arsenal. By understanding and applying the principles enshrined in these acts, you can make a meaningful difference in the lives of workers and help create a culture of safety and well-being in the workplace. So, let us dive in and explore the fascinating world of OHS legislation in South Africa!

OHSA: Your Cornerstone for Workplace Safety The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) Simplified.

The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) of 1993 is a crucial piece of legislation that governs workplace safety in South Africa. It is essential for every aspiring OHS professional to understand the act's background, objectives, and key provisions.

Constitutional Perspective: The OHSA is rooted in the Constitution of South Africa, which enshrines the right to a safe and healthy working environment. Section 24 of the Constitution guarantees everyone the right to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being, laying the foundation for the OHSA.
Precursors to the OHSA: Before the OHSA, workplace safety was governed by various pieces of legislation, such as the Factories, Machinery and Building Work Act of 1941. However, these laws were fragmented and often inadequate in addressing the diverse range of occupational hazards across industries.
Introduction and Objectives: The OHSA was introduced in 1993 to consolidate and modernise workplace safety legislation in South Africa. Its primary objectives are:
To provide for the health and safety of persons at work.
To protect others against hazards arising from work activities.
To establish an advisory council for occupational health and safety.

The act aims to create a comprehensive framework for promoting and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for all employees.Its key sections include:
Duties of Employers (Section 8): Employers must provide and maintain a safe working environment, ensure the safety of machinery and equipment, and provide necessary training and supervision.
Duties of Employees (Section 14): Employees must take reasonable care for their own health and safety and that of others, cooperate with employers, and report any unsafe conditions or incidents.
Health and Safety Representatives (Section 17): Every employer with 20 or more employees must designate health and safety representatives to promote and monitor workplace safety.
Health and Safety Committees (Section 19): Employers must establish health and safety committees in workplaces with two or more health and safety representatives.
Inspectors (Section 28): The Minister may designate inspectors to monitor and enforce compliance with the OHSA.
Sanctions for Non-Compliance: The OHSA provides for various penalties for non-compliance, depending on the nature and severity of the offence. These may include:
Fines of up to R100,000.
Imprisonment for up to two years.
Temporary or permanent closure of the workplace.
Prohibition of the use of hazardous machinery or processes.

The Occupational Health and Safety Act is the cornerstone of workplace safety legislation in South Africa. It establishes a comprehensive framework for promoting and maintaining a safe and healthy working environment, with clear responsibilities for employers and employees. As an aspiring OHS professional, understanding the OHSA is crucial for ensuring compliance, promoting best practices, and ultimately, protecting the well-being of workers in every industry.
COIDA Overview: Protecting Workers' Rights and Well-being The Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act (COIDA).
The Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act (COIDA) of 1993 is a vital piece of legislation that works hand-in-hand with the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) to protect workers in South Africa. While the OHSA focuses on preventing workplace accidents and diseases, COIDA provides a framework for compensating employees who suffer work-related injuries or illnesses.

Objectives of COIDA:
To provide compensation for disablement caused by occupational injuries or diseases, or for death resulting from such injuries or diseases.
To establish a compensation fund from which benefits are paid to affected employees or their dependents.
To provide for the reporting of accidents and occupational diseases, and the claiming of benefits.

Complementing the OHSA: COIDA complements the OHSA by ensuring that workers who suffer from work-related injuries or diseases are adequately compensated and supported. While the OHSA aims to prevent such incidents from occurring, COIDA provides a safety net for those who are affected despite preventive measures.

Key Aspects of COIDA: 
Compensation Commissioner (Section 2): The act establishes the office of the Compensation Commissioner, who is responsible for administering COIDA and managing the compensation fund.
Compensation Fund (Section 15): Employers are required to contribute to the compensation fund, which is used to pay benefits to employees or their dependents in case of work-related injuries, diseases, or death.
Reporting of Accidents and Occupational Diseases (Section 39): Employers must report any work-related accidents or occupational diseases to the Compensation Commissioner within seven days of the incident.
Types of Benefits: COIDA provides various types of benefits, including:
Temporary disablement benefits
Permanent disablement benefits
Medical expenses
Death benefits for dependents
Importance for OHS Professionals:

As an aspiring OHS professional, understanding COIDA is essential for several reasons:
Ensuring Compliance: OHS professionals must ensure that their organisations comply with COIDA by reporting accidents and occupational diseases and contributing to the compensation fund.
Assisting Employees: OHS professionals can help employees navigate the claiming process and ensure they receive the benefits they are entitled to under COIDA.
Identifying Trends: By analysing COIDA claims data, OHS professionals can identify patterns in workplace injuries and diseases, informing their prevention strategies under the OHSA.
Penalties for Non-Compliance: Non-compliance with COIDA can result in penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Employers who fail to report accidents or occupational diseases, or who do not contribute to the compensation fund, may face legal consequences.

The Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act is a crucial companion to the Occupational Health and Safety Act. While the OHSA focuses on prevention, COIDA ensures that workers who suffer from work-related injuries or diseases are adequately compensated and supported. As an OHS professional, understanding and ensuring compliance with both acts is essential for promoting a safe and healthy work environment and protecting the well-being of employees.

MHSA: A Straightforward Look at the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA).
This is a sector-specific legislation that regulates health and safety in the South African mining industry. It was introduced to address the unique challenges and risks associated with mining, which were not adequately covered by the more general Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA).

Objectives of the MHSA:
To protect the health and safety of mine employees and other persons at mines.
 To require employers and employees to identify hazards and eliminate, control, and minimise the risks related to health and safety at mines.
To promote a culture of health and safety in the mining industry.
To provide for the enforcement of health and safety measures at mines.

Relevance to the OHSA: While the OHSA applies to most workplaces in South Africa, it has limitations when it comes to the mining industry. The MHSA was introduced to address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive and tailored approach to health and safety in mines. Some key differences between the MHSA and OHSA include:
Sector-Specific Requirements: The MHSA contains provisions that are specific to the mining industry, such as requirements for mine design, ventilation, and rescue services.
Tripartite Approach: The MHSA promotes a tripartite approach to health and safety, involving government, employers, and employees in decision-making and policy development.
Emphasis on Risk Management: The MHSA places a strong emphasis on risk management, requiring employers and employees to continuously identify, assess, and control risks.

Relationship with COIDA: The MHSA works in conjunction with COIDA to ensure that mine employees who suffer from work-related injuries or diseases are adequately compensated. While the MHSA focuses on preventing accidents and diseases in mines, COIDA provides a framework for compensating affected employees. Mine employers are required to contribute to the compensation fund under COIDA, and mine employees can claim benefits in case of work-related injuries or diseases.

Key Aspects of the MHSA:
Health and Safety Policy (Section 8): Mine employers must prepare and implement a health and safety policy, in consultation with employee representatives.
Risk Management (Section 11): Mine employers must identify hazards, assess risks, and implement measures to eliminate, control, and minimise risks.
Health and Safety Committees (Section 34): Every mine with 20 or more employees must establish a health and safety committee to promote and monitor health and safety at the mine.
Inspectors (Section 49): The Minister may appoint inspectors to monitor and enforce compliance with the MHSA.

Importance for OHS Professionals: For OHS professionals working in the mining industry, understanding and ensuring compliance with the MHSA is crucial. The act provides a framework for promoting and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment in mines, taking into account the unique risks and challenges of the sector.

Penalties for Non-Compliance: Non-compliance with the MHSA can result in penalties, including fines and imprisonment. The act provides for a range of enforcement measures, including the issuance of instructions, prohibitions, and closure orders by inspectors.

The Mine Health and Safety Act is a sector-specific legislation that complements the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act in the mining industry. It addresses the unique health and safety challenges in mines and promotes a culture of risk management and tripartite collaboration. For OHS professionals in the mining sector, understanding and ensuring compliance with the MHSA is essential for protecting the health and safety of mine employees.
NBRBSA: Building a Foundation for Safe Structures, the National Building Regulations and Building Standards Act (NBRBSA).

The National Building Regulations and Building Standards Act 103 of 1977 (NBRBSA) is a pivotal piece of legislation in South Africa that governs the standards and regulations for construction and building practices. The Act plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and quality of buildings and structures, aligning with the broader objectives of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) to protect the health and safety of individuals in the built environment.

Relationship with the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA): The NBRBSA and the OHSA are interlinked in their objectives to ensure safety in the workplace, especially concerning construction and building activities. While the OHSA focuses on the overall health and safety of workers in all industries, the NBRBSA specifically targets the safety and quality standards of buildings and structures. Both Acts aim to prevent hazards and risks that could lead to accidents, injuries, or fatalities, emphasising the importance of compliance with building regulations to ensure a safe working environment.

Precursors:  Before the enactment of the NBRBSA in 1977, various building standards and regulations were in place across different municipalities and regions in South Africa. The Act was introduced to consolidate these regulations into a unified national standard, providing a comprehensive framework for building control and regulation throughout the country.

Scope:  The NBRBSA governs the design, construction, alteration, and demolition of buildings and structures in South Africa. It sets out the minimum requirements and standards for various aspects of building construction, including:
Structural stability

Ventilation
Lighting
Drainage
Energy usage
Accessibility for persons with disabilities.

Key Sections: The NBRBSA is structured into various sections, each addressing different aspects of building regulations. Some of the key sections include:
Section 4: Empowers the Minister to make regulations regarding building standards and requirements.
Section 5: Sets out the procedure for the approval of building plans and designs by local authorities.
Section 6: Addresses the powers of local authorities to regulate building activities within their jurisdictions.
Section 7: Provides for the establishment of an advisory committee to assist the Minister in matters related to building standards and regulations.

Penalties: Non-compliance with the provisions of the NBRBSA can result in penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Local authorities are responsible for enforcing the Act and ensuring that building activities within their jurisdictions comply with the prescribed standards and regulations.

Regulations: The NBRBSA consists of various regulations that provide detailed requirements and standards for different aspects of building construction. There are currently over 20 regulations under the Act, each focusing on specific areas of building control and regulation. Some of the top regulations include; 
Regulation A - Application of the Act: This regulation outlines the scope and application of the NBRBSA, defining the types of buildings and structures to which the Act applies and the procedures for obtaining approval for building plans and designs.
Regulation B - Administrative Procedures: Regulation B sets out the administrative procedures for the submission, approval, and inspection of building plans and designs by local authorities. It also specifies the requirements for the appointment of building control officers and the procedures for the issuance of building permits.
Regulation D - Structural Design: This regulation prescribes the minimum requirements and standards for the structural design and stability of buildings and structures. It includes provisions for the design of foundations, walls, floors, and roofs to ensure structural integrity and safety.
Regulation G - Drainage and Sanitation: Regulation G sets out the requirements for the design and installation of drainage and sanitation systems in buildings. It includes provisions for the disposal of wastewater, sewage, and stormwater to prevent environmental pollution and public health risks.
Regulation T - Fire Protection: Regulation T focuses on fire safety requirements and standards for buildings and structures. It includes provisions for the installation of fire detection, alarm, and suppression systems, as well as the design of escape routes and access for firefighting equipment to ensure the protection of occupants and property against fire hazards.

The National Building Regulations and Building Standards Act 103 of 1977 (NBRBSA) is a critical piece of legislation in South Africa that governs the standards and regulations for construction and building practices. With its comprehensive framework and stringent requirements, the Act plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety, quality, and sustainability of buildings and structures, aligning with the broader objectives of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA). Compliance with the NBRBSA is essential for all stakeholders involved in the construction industry to prevent hazards, protect the environment, and ensure the well-being of individuals in the built environment.
As we conclude this section on South Africa's pivotal Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) legislation, it becomes evident that a deep understanding of these acts is indispensable for OHS professionals. The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA), the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act (COIDA), the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA), and the National Building Regulations and Building Standards Act (NBRBSA) collectively underscore our nation's commitment to safeguarding the health, safety, and well-being of workers across diverse industries.
This guide offers a foundational overview of these acts. However, professionals must delve deeper into the original text of these legislations to grasp their nuances and intricacies accurately. While this summary provides a starting point, the original legislation remains the definitive reference for accuracy and comprehensive understanding.
Understanding the application of OHS legislation is paramount. Non-compliance can lead to severe consequences, both civil and criminal. Employers and individuals contravening these acts may incur significant fines and, in severe instances, imprisonment. As highlighted in section 37 of the OHSA, employers can face vicarious liability, holding them accountable for the actions or negligence of their employees in the workplace. Furthermore, employers failing to ensure that their contractors comply with COIDA provisions can be held liable for the medical expenses of the contractor's employees.
OHS legislation does not operate in isolation. These acts collaborate with local bylaws and national/international standards. For instance, emergency bylaws, regulating organisational responses to emergencies like fires or natural disasters, align closely with OHSA provisions. Likewise, standards such as SANS 1475, which stipulates the servicing of fire extinguishers, ensure equipment maintenance that supports OHSA objectives.
For OHS professionals, navigating this intricate legal framework is crucial. It's not just about compliance but fostering a proactive approach to health and safety. By assimilating the legal framework and implementing its principles, professionals can significantly influence worker safety and contribute to a safer, healthier South Africa.
Embarking on a career in OHS requires recognizing that understanding these acts transcends mere professional obligation; it's a catalyst for positive change. Upholding the principles of these acts creates workplaces where employees can flourish, with their well-being prioritised.

Understanding Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Plans
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) plans are comprehensive documents that outline an organisation's strategies and procedures for managing and mitigating workplace risks and hazards. These plans are crucial for safeguarding the health and well-being of employees, ensuring compliance with legal requirements, and promoting a culture of safety and responsibility within the organisation.

Background and Justification for OHS Plans
This chapter establishes the legal foundation for OHS plans in South Africa. We explore the constitutional right to a safe work environment, delve into the Occupational Health and Safety Act, and examine international standards like OHSAS 18000 and ISO 45000 that guide effective OHS management.

Constitutional Provisions: The Constitution of South Africa, specifically Section 24, enshrines the right to a safe and healthy environment. This constitutional provision underscores the importance of OHS and the legal obligation of businesses to ensure a safe working environment for their employees.
Statutory Justification with OHS Specific Legislation: The Occupational Health and Safety Act (Act No. 85 of 1993) is the primary legislation governing OHS in South Africa. This legislation sets out the legal requirements for employers to provide a safe working environment, conduct risk assessments, and implement appropriate control measures to mitigate workplace risks and hazards.
Standards: OHSAS 18000 and ISO 45000: OHSAS 18001 and ISO 45001 are internationally recognized standards that provide a framework for implementing and maintaining effective Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (OHSMS). These standards help organisations to identify, assess, and manage OHS risks, improve OHS performance, and demonstrate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

Advantages of Having an OHS Plan
The benefits of a strong OHS plan are multifaceted. We'll examine how it safeguards employee well-being, minimises legal risks, boosts productivity, and ultimately enhances your company's reputation and brand image.

Enhanced Employee Safety and Well-being: A well-implemented OHS plan can significantly reduce workplace accidents and injuries, thereby protecting the physical and mental well-being of employees.
Legal Compliance and Risk Management: An OHS plan ensures compliance with OHS legislation, standards, and best practices, reducing the risk of legal liabilities, penalties, and sanctions.
Improved Productivity and Performance: A safe and healthy work environment promotes employee satisfaction, morale, and productivity, contributing to organisational success and competitiveness.
Enhanced Employee Relations: Prioritising employee safety demonstrates your commitment to their well-being. This fosters trust and strengthens your relationship with employees, resulting in a more positive and collaborative work culture.
Reduced Insurance Costs: Companies with a demonstrably strong OHS program can often leverage lower insurance premiums. A consistent safety record indicates a lower risk of accidents and injuries, making your business a more attractive proposition for insurance companies.
Enhanced Reputation and Brand Image: Demonstrating a commitment to OHS can enhance the organisation's reputation, build trust with stakeholders, and attract and retain clients and customers who prioritise safety and responsibility.

The Cost of Non-Compliance with OHS Requirements
Non-compliance with Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) requirements can have significant financial, legal, and reputational consequences for organisations. The cost of non-compliance extends beyond potential fines and penalties to include medical expenses, compensation claims, increased insurance premiums, and loss of productivity. Furthermore, non-compliance can damage an organisation's reputation, resulting in loss of clients, stakeholders' trust, and business opportunities.

Financial Costs: Non-compliance with OHS requirements can result in substantial financial costs for organisations. These costs may include fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities, medical expenses for injured employees, compensation claims, increased insurance premiums, and costs associated with implementing corrective measures to address identified non-compliance issues.
Legal Costs: Failure to comply with OHS requirements can lead to legal actions, lawsuits, and litigation against organisations. The legal costs associated with defending against these actions, settling claims, and compensating affected parties can be significant and detrimental to an organisation's financial stability and reputation.
Reputational Costs: Non-compliance with OHS requirements can damage an organisation's reputation, resulting in loss of clients, stakeholders' trust, and business opportunities. Negative publicity, media coverage, and public perception of an organisation's commitment to safety and responsibility can have long-lasting and detrimental effects on its brand image and market competitiveness.

OHS Requirements for Listing a Business on a Stock Exchange
For businesses listed on a stock exchange in South Africa, compliance with OHS legislation, standards, and best practices is not only a legal requirement but also a critical component of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria. Investors and stakeholders increasingly consider OHS performance and practices when making investment decisions, reflecting a growing recognition of the importance of OHS in sustainable business growth and profitability.

OHS and the Companies Act
The Companies Act, 2008 (Act No. 71 of 2008) requires companies to act in the best interests of all stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, and the community. An effective OHS plan is essential for fulfilling this obligation by safeguarding the health and well-being of employees, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and promoting responsible and sustainable business practices.
Regardless of geographical location or industry sector, organisations worldwide can benefit from implementing effective OHS plans to protect employees, comply with legal and regulatory requirements, enhance reputation and brand image, and promote sustainable growth and profitability. As such, the importance of OHS transcends borders and should be a fundamental consideration for businesses operating in any global context.


Legal Framework and Compliance
Understanding the legal framework governing OHS plans is crucial for employers to ensure compliance and effectively manage workplace risks. The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) No. 85 of 1993 is the primary legislation in South Africa that governs OHS in workplaces. This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the specific sections of the OHSA dealing with OHS plans and outlines the regulations explicitly requiring OHS plans.

OHS Plans under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA)
The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) No. 85 of 1993 forms the foundation for OHS management in South Africa across various sectors, excluding mining which is governed by the MHSA.  Below are the specific sections of the OHSA dealing with OHS plans:

Section 8, Duty to Provide and Maintain a Safe Working Environment: "Every employer shall provide and maintain, as far as is reasonably practicable, a working environment that is safe and without risk to the health of his employees."  Compliance to this section can be demonstrated with the development and implementation of an OHS Plan showing the employer has implemented measures to provide and maintain a safe working environment.
Section 9, Duties of Employers to Non-Employees:  "Every employer shall conduct his undertaking in such a manner as to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that persons other than those in his employment who may be directly affected by his activities are not thereby exposed to hazards to their health or safety."  Employers must ensure that their OHS plan includes measures to protect non-employees, such as contractors, visitors, and the public, from workplace hazards.
Section 14, Duties of Employees: "Every employee shall at work—   (a) take reasonable care for the health and safety of himself and of other persons who may be affected by his acts or omissions;"   Employers must provide training and information to employees on their responsibilities for health and safety as part of the OHS plan.
Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act Requiring OHS Plans
Several regulations under the OHSA require the development and implementation of OHS plans to manage and mitigate OHS Risks. This list is not comprehensive but below are the key regulations:

General Safety Regulations (GSR): Regulation 2 (1): "every employer and every user of machinery shall make an evaluation of the risk attached to any condition or situation which may arise from the activities of such employer or user, as the case may be, and to which persons at a workplace or in the course of their employment or in connection with the use of machinery are exposed, and he shall take such steps as may under the circumstances be necessary to make such condition or situation safe."
Asbestos Abatement Regulations:  Regulation 6: "asbestos -containing materials are identified, as required in regulation 3, the employer or self -employed person must ensure that a written asbestos management plan for the workplace is prepared by a competent p."  Employers must prepare a written asbestos management plan.
Construction Regulations:  
Regulation 5:  "A client must - (a) prepare a baseline risk assessment for an intended construction work project. (b) prepare a suitably, sufficiently documented and coherent site specific health and safety specification for the intended construction work based on the baseline risk assessment.
Regulation 7: “A principal contractor must - provide and demonstrate to the client a suitable, sufficiently documented and coherent site specific health and safety plan, based on the client’s documented health and safety specifications contemplated in regulation 5(1)(b), which plan must be applied from the date of commencement of and for the duration of the construction work and which must be viewed and updated by the principal contractor as work in progress”

OHS Plans under the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA)
The Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA) No. 29 of 1996 serves as the cornerstone of occupational health and safety (OHS) legislation in the South African mining industry. 
The MHSA emphasises the importance of proactive safety measures through the following sections:

Section 2: This section places a duty on mine owners to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the health and safety of their employees. An OHS plan serves as a critical tool for fulfilling this duty by outlining a comprehensive strategy to identify, assess, and control workplace hazards.
Section 5: This section requires a Manager to maintain a healthy and safe mine environment.

Application of the Legal Framework Internationally
The principles and requirements outlined are consistent with international OHS standards and best practices. Employers worldwide can benefit from understanding and implementing similar legal requirements to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for all.



Critical Stakeholders in Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Plans
Effective Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) planning is a collaborative effort that demands commitment and engagement from various stakeholders, both within and outside the organisation. 
These stakeholders are instrumental in the development, implementation, monitoring, and review of OHS plans, thereby fostering a safe and healthy working environment, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and cultivating a culture of safety and responsibility among employees.
This section further explores the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders from the board of directors and the CEO, including senior management, OHS professionals, employees, trade unions, regulatory authorities, and external partners, in enhancing OHS planning and management within organisations.

The Board of Directors
The Board of Directors holds a pivotal role in OHS planning and management. As mandated by various legislations, including the Companies Act, King IV principles, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) requirements, and ethical standards, the Board is responsible for:
Setting OHS Policies and Objectives: The Board is accountable for establishing clear and comprehensive OHS policies, objectives, and strategies aligned with the organisation's overall mission, vision, and values.
Overseeing OHS Performance and Compliance: The Board is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the organisation's OHS performance, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and addressing any identified non-compliance issues promptly and effectively.
Allocating Resources for OHS: The Board must allocate adequate resources, including finances, personnel, and technologies, to support the development, implementation, and maintenance of effective OHS management systems and initiatives.
Promoting a Culture of Safety and Responsibility: The Board plays a crucial role in promoting a culture of safety, responsibility, and continuous improvement throughout the organisation by setting a positive example, demonstrating leadership commitment to OHS, and engaging with employees and stakeholders on OHS matters.
These Responsibilities are informed by the Companies Act and King IV Principles:
Companies Act (Act 71 of 2008): In terms of the Companies Act, 2008 of South Africa, the board of directors has a fiduciary duty to ensure the health and safety of employees and stakeholders. Directors must act in good faith and in the best interests of the company, exercising the required care, skill, and diligence to protect the health and safety of individuals involved in the company's operations. They are responsible for implementing and overseeing effective health and safety policies, procedures, and practices, ensuring compliance with relevant legislation, and addressing any health and safety risks or issues that may arise within the company's operations.
King IV Principles on Corporate Governance: King IV, a corporate governance code in South Africa, emphasises the board's responsibility for the health and safety of employees and stakeholders. The board is mandated to ensure a corporate culture that promotes ethical and responsible decision-making, which includes prioritising health and safety. The board should ensure that the organisation's strategy is sustainable and should oversee the implementation of policies and practices to manage health, safety, and environmental risks effectively.

Building and maintaining a robust OHS plan requires a concerted effort from a diverse group of stakeholders.  We've explored the critical roles played by the board of directors, senior management, OHS professionals, employees, trade unions, regulatory authorities, and external partners.  Each stakeholder brings a unique perspective and set of skills to the table, and their collective commitment is essential for creating a safe and healthy work environment.
The board of directors holds a particularly influential position. Their leadership sets the tone for the entire organisation.  By actively engaging in their OHS responsibilities, as outlined in this chapter, the board demonstrates the highest ethical leadership and commitment to ESG compliance.  This translates into allocating adequate resources for OHS initiatives, holding management accountable for performance, and fostering a culture of safety and responsibility throughout the organisation.
While the specific governance frameworks may differ internationally, with some countries lacking a King IV code or a Companies Act with identical provisions, the core principles remain consistent.  International OHS standards like ISO 45001 emphasise the importance of leadership commitment, risk management, and continual improvement in safety performance.  Regardless of location, effective OHS plans require a leadership team that prioritises employee well-being, integrates safety into decision-making, and champions a culture of ethical and responsible business practices.

By fostering a collaborative environment where all stakeholders are empowered to contribute to OHS efforts, organisations can create a symphony of safety. This collaborative approach, coupled with strong leadership from the board, ensures a safe and healthy workplace for all employees, minimises legal risks, and positions the organisation for long-term success in today's globalised and ethically conscious marketplace.


Process Steps for Compilation of the OHS Plan
Developing a comprehensive OHS plan is the cornerstone of creating a safe and healthy work environment. This chapter guides you through the essential steps involved in compiling an effective OHS plan, equipping you to proactively manage workplace hazards and risks.

Bringing Your OHS Plan to Life: Implementation Strategies
Having meticulously crafted your OHS plan, it's now time to translate its principles into action. This chapter equips you with the essential strategies for implementing your OHS plan and fostering a culture of safety within your organisation. Remember, a well-crafted plan is only as effective as its implementation.  Here, we'll explore key steps to bridge the gap between planning and practice.

Building a Culture of Safety Through Communication and Awareness
Establishing a strong culture of safety is vital for the success of any Occupational Health and Safety plan. Here we emphasise the importance of effective communication, ongoing safety awareness, and leading by example to foster a workplace where safety is a core value and priority for all.

Launching the OHS Plan: A successful launch sets the tone for ongoing safety efforts.  Communicate the OHS plan effectively from the highest levels to all employees through engaging induction programs, informative meetings, and clear visual materials displayed throughout the workplace.
Promoting Ongoing Safety Awareness: Don't let safety become an afterthought.  Develop and implement awareness campaigns to keep safety at the forefront of employee minds.  This may involve regular safety talks, informative newsletters, engaging toolbox meetings, and strategically placed safety posters.
Role-Modeling Safety Leadership:  Actions speak louder than words.  Organisational leaders must actively demonstrate their commitment to safety through their behaviours and decisions.  Leaders who participate in safety inspections, address safety concerns promptly, and prioritise safety investments send a powerful message that safety is a core value of the organisation.

Providing the Tools for Success: Resource Allocation
Ensuring a successful OHS plan involves more than just planning and strategy; it requires the right resources for effective implementation and maintenance. This part underscores the significance of allocating adequate finances, personnel, and equipment to support the OHS plan. It emphasises the importance of prioritising OHS investments as strategic decisions that not only enhance workplace safety but also contribute to the overall productivity and success of the organisation.

Securing Necessary Resources: An effective OHS plan requires investment.  Allocate sufficient finances, personnel, and equipment to effectively implement and maintain the OHS plan.  Conduct a comprehensive resource assessment to identify any gaps and develop a plan to secure the necessary resources.
Prioritising OHS Investments: Safety is not just an expense; it's an investment.  Recognize that investments in workplace safety contribute to long-term cost savings by minimising the financial burden of accidents, injuries, illnesses, and associated legal repercussions.  A healthy and safe workforce is a productive workforce.

Establishing Robust OHS Management Systems: The Backbone of Safety
A comprehensive OHS plan is only as effective as the systems that support it. This section highlights the importance of establishing robust OHS management systems as the backbone of safety in the organisation. From streamlined document management to proactive safety measures, each aspect plays a critical role in ensuring a safe and compliant work environment.

Streamlined Document Management: Establish a user-friendly system for managing OHS documentation, ensuring easy access for employees, relevant stakeholders, and auditors.  This system should promote compliance by making critical safety information readily available.
Incident Reporting, Investigation, and Learning: Implement a robust system for reporting, investigating, and learning from incidents and near misses.  Encourage a culture of open reporting by providing employees with a safe and confidential way to report safety concerns.  Investigate all incidents thoroughly to identify root causes and implement corrective actions to prevent future occurrences.
Proactive Safety: Preventive Maintenance Programs: Develop and implement a preventative maintenance program to identify and address potential hazards before accidents occur.  Regular inspections and maintenance of equipment, machinery, and facilities can significantly reduce the risk of workplace incidents.

Integrating Safety into Daily Operations: Embedding Safety in Every Action
Embedding safety into daily operations is crucial for the sustained success of an OHS plan. This section emphasises proactive measures like Job Safety Analysis (JSAs) and Permit-to-Work Systems, which help in identifying and mitigating risks associated with specific tasks. Moreover, continuous performance monitoring and improvement are pivotal in making safety an inherent part of the organisational culture.

Job Safety Analysis (JSAs):  Make safety an integral part of every task.  Conduct regular JSAs to identify potential hazards associated with specific tasks and implement effective control measures to mitigate those risks.  JSAs empower employees to actively participate in safety conversations and identify potential hazards before they cause harm.
Permit-to-Work Systems for High-Risk Activities: For high-risk activities, utilise permit-to-work systems to ensure proper planning, preparation, and oversight.  These systems establish clear procedures, require qualified personnel involvement, and promote a more controlled approach to potentially hazardous tasks.
Performance Monitoring and Continuous Improvement: Safety is an ongoing journey, not a destination.  Continuously monitor OHS performance metrics like incident rates, near misses reported, and employee safety satisfaction surveys.  Analyse this data to identify areas for improvement and implement corrective actions where necessary.  Embrace a culture of continuous improvement, striving to make safety an even greater priority every day.

Successfully implementing your OHS plan requires a multi-faceted approach.  By fostering a culture of safety through communication and awareness, allocating adequate resources, establishing robust OHS management systems, and integrating safety into daily operations, you can turn your plan into a living document that actively safeguards your employees and protects your organisation. 
Remember, safety is not just about compliance; it's about creating a work environment where everyone feels valued, empowered, and equipped to work safely and productively.  This chapter has provided a roadmap for implementing your OHS plan, but the journey towards a truly safe workplace is an ongoing one.  Through ongoing commitment, collaboration, and a continuous pursuit of improvement, you can create a lasting legacy of safety within your organisation.

Testing and Review of the OHS Plan
Ensuring a safe and healthy work environment is a continuous commitment that goes beyond the initial development and implementation of an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) plan. Regular testing and review of the OHS plan are essential components of this commitment, designed to evaluate the plan's effectiveness, relevance, and compliance with occupational health and safety standards.
The objective of this section is to guide organisations through the crucial processes of testing and reviewing their OHS plans. These processes are not only about compliance but also about proactively identifying and addressing potential weaknesses, gaps, and areas for improvement. By doing so, organisations can enhance their ability to prevent accidents, incidents, and injuries, thereby promoting a safe and healthy working environment for all employees.
We will explore the frequency and methods of testing and review, highlighting the importance of stakeholder input and the integration of insights from accidents and incidents. Practical case studies will be presented to illustrate effective testing and review practices in various organisational contexts, offering valuable insights, solutions, and best practices to enhance the effectiveness and compliance of the OHS management system.
By prioritising the testing and review of the OHS plan, organisations demonstrate their commitment to continuous improvement in occupational health and safety, fostering a culture of safety, responsibility, and well-being among employees.
Frequency of Testing and Review
The frequency of testing and reviewing the OHS plan should be determined based on the organisation's size, nature of operations, level of risks, and compliance requirements. Generally, the OHS plan should be tested and reviewed at least annually or following significant changes in the organisation's operations, processes, or legislation.
Establish a regular schedule for testing and reviewing the OHS plan, policies, procedures, and practices.
Conduct interim reviews and assessments following significant changes, incidents, accidents, or non-compliance issues to ensure continuous improvement and compliance.

Methods of Testing and Review
Various methods can be employed to test and review the OHS plan, including internal audits, external audits, inspections, observations, surveys, and consultations with stakeholders. 
Conduct internal audits and assessments by qualified and competent OHS professionals to evaluate the OHS plan's compliance, effectiveness, and performance.
Engage external auditors and certification bodies to conduct independent audits and assessments of the OHS management system against relevant legislation, regulations, and standards, such as ISO 45001.
Perform regular inspections and observations of the workplace, processes, activities, and equipment to identify potential risks, hazards, and non-compliance issues.

Measuring Progress: Assessing Compliance with OHS Standards
An effective Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) plan is not merely a set of procedures but serves as a comprehensive roadmap for achieving and sustaining compliance with relevant legislation, international standards, and best practices. Regularly assessing compliance with OHS regulations, standards, and best practices is crucial for maintaining a robust safety culture and demonstrating an unwavering commitment to continuous improvement in workplace safety.
This chapter is designed to guide organisations & professionals through the process of evaluating their OHS plans against established benchmarks, identifying areas for improvement, and fostering a culture of accountability and transparency. We will also discuss the significance of staying updated on international best practices in OHS. By actively researching industry trends, benchmarking against leading organisations, and integrating emerging technologies, organisations can further enhance their OHS efforts and foster a culture that prioritises employee well-being.
By proactively assessing and measuring progress in compliance with OHS standards, organisations can minimise legal risks, build trust and confidence with stakeholders and regulators, and position themselves as leaders in workplace safety. This commitment not only safeguards employees but also contributes to improved morale, reduced absenteeism due to work-related injuries, and potentially lower insurance premiums.

Assessing Compliance with OHS Legislation
The foundation of any OHS management system lies in adherence to relevant legislation.  
Here's how to assess compliance:

Identify Applicable Legislation: Conduct a thorough review to determine all OHS legislation, regulations, and codes of practice applicable to your industry and operations. (e.g., OHS Act, Construction Regulations)
Gap Analysis: Compare your existing OHS plan and practices with the requirements outlined in the identified legislation. This helps pinpoint any gaps or areas where your plan falls short.  Conducting gap analyses at regular intervals ensures your OHS plan remains aligned with any changes or updates in legal requirements.
Taking Corrective Action:  Develop and implement corrective action plans to address identified gaps and ensure full compliance with legal requirements.  This may involve revising policies, procedures, or implementing new control measures to mitigate identified hazards.  Track the progress of corrective actions and ensure their effectiveness in achieving compliance.

By proactively assessing compliance with OHS legislation, you minimise legal risks and demonstrate a commitment to operating within the established legal framework.  This not only safeguards your employees but also fosters trust and confidence with stakeholders, regulators, and the wider community.

Assessing Compliance with OHS Standards (OHSAS 18000 & ISO 45001)
International OHS standards like OHSAS 18001 (now superseded by ISO 45001) provide a comprehensive framework for developing and implementing an effective OHS management system.  While achieving certification is not mandatory, it demonstrates a commitment to best practices:

Understanding the Standard:  Familiarise yourself with the key requirements of ISO 45001, which outlines a systematic approach to managing OHS risks and continually improving performance.  The standard emphasises leadership commitment, risk management, worker participation, and continual improvement.
Internal Audits: Conduct regular internal audits to assess your OHS management system against the requirements of ISO 45001, identifying areas for improvement.  Internal audits can be conducted by qualified internal personnel or external auditors.
Considering External Certification: While not mandatory, achieving ISO 45001 certification demonstrates your commitment to a robust OHS management system and can provide a competitive advantage. Certification bodies conduct a rigorous audit of your OHS practices to ensure compliance with the standard.  Maintaining certification requires ongoing commitment to continual improvement.

By aligning your OHS plan with international best practices embodied in standards like ISO 45001, you elevate your safety culture and showcase your dedication to employee well-being.  This can lead to improved employee morale, reduced absenteeism due to work-related injuries, and potentially lower insurance premiums.

Purpose 
The aim of this health and safety plan is to display the OHS controls as per client's specification. In line with the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 85 of 1993, as well as the Construction Regulations, we take the greatest care not only towards statutory requirements but also ensuring that our activities during the construction do not negatively impact the client's employees, visitors, clients, and other stakeholders, as well as the surrounding environment for the duration of the contract.

This plan will be implemented after approval by the client and will be maintained throughout the duration of the project. Measures to ensure compliance include (but not limited to):

Delegation of OHS responsibilities through legal appointments,
Risk eliminations and mitigation strategies,
COID registration as well as implementation of incident management procedures,
Emergency Response Planning to cater for all incidents from First Aid to Disasters,
Management of subcontractors,
Training and induction to ensure competency.
To ensure compliance, induction training for all entering the site will serve as prerequisites supported by continuous supervision of the site activities. In addition to specific competency requirements, ongoing training through toolbox talks will be implemented for all employees.

The Homeschooling Father, 
Why and How I got started





"A courageously and brilliantly written, tell-it-like-it-is summation of the challenges endemic in education in Mzansi—and elsewhere, frankly—and the knock-on effect that permeates society and employment. 
With its entrenched culture of entitlement, patronage, cadre deployment, and good old-fashioned construction mafia shakedowns, the narrative is both gripping and enlightening.
More refreshing still is the hope offered by the author in the way of solutions and a can-do spirit; not just another list of only problems. 
This author and writing is one of South Africa’s best-kept secrets, as far as I am concerned. Among other things, it is inspiring me to seriously contemplate homeschooling my children—though it covers so much more ground than that alone.


Do yourself a favour and read this work. 


Share it widely and often.


Kudos, Salatiso. 
Thanks for the inspiration."

To my family, thank you for being a source of strength for me throughout my life, even when I thought otherwise. 
The only way I can show gratitude to those that preceded me, without whom I wouldn’t be is to do my best by their descendants.
My partner, who came to my life when it mattered the most. 
SK & SN, cousins and all the loyal friends who supported me. 
The many teachers I have had over the years, who have aspired to inspire by doing their best, and the many communities from whom I have lived and learned, professional and personal.

Notes


Preface
Certain ideas have become so prevalent in modern society that some people are even willing to enforce them through the use of laws, as if they are guaranteed to bring about favourable results. One of these ideas is formal schooling, especially when made compulsory.
This idea advocates that the people best suited to teach one's children are everyone but the parents and family.
Parents are no longer capable of making informed decisions about their children's curriculum. We can't object to activities that are arbitrary and sometimes harmful to our progeny. The Basic Education Laws Amendment (BELA) Bill threatens to erode the remaining control that parents had over formal schools, as it aims to centralize decision-making power in the hands of detached surrogates who do not have a personal stake. We must be happy relying on outside surrogates, credentialed experts, and professionals who are believed to know more about our children than we do. 
It all begins with politicians who are fully cognizant that feigning concern for the well-being of vulnerable children is one of the most powerful strategies to secure victory in elections.
Academics funded by generous taxpayer-funded grants obtained with the aid of these politicians publish research confirming the prevailing opinion. Favoured individuals pretending to be experts and professionals are given high-status positions and profitable contracts to create and carry out a curriculum for the whole country.
Progressive ideas and popular trends frequently attempt to supplant the age-old knowledge that children acquire at home; knowledge that has been passed down through generations. For 12 years, they consistently emphasize the importance of their role in the child's life, resulting in a loyal client who guarantees a thriving business for the surrogates.
They portray everyone other than the parent and family as the most competent teacher, and any other service conventionally provided by the parent. Critics and resistant parents are dismissed as old-fashioned or even treated as criminals for not following the approach and giving up their children to the experts.
Traditional values that ensured our ancestors' survival are no longer considered important by specialists and experts in child education, who prefer more profitable and trendy ideas.
What happens when these ideas are encouraged and parents agree to have their children raised by everyone except themselves? 
What happens when the ideas from those impressive speakers, who discuss modern educational curriculums on the most influential platforms of our time, are put into practice long enough to produce measurable results? 
South Africa 2023 happens. 
No generation in this country has received as much formal education as the post-1994 generation. How is the formal schooling system doing as a replacement for parents and family as primary teachers of children?
Unemployment is at its highest level, surpassing the levels seen before 1994.
The probability of being murdered is higher than in some war zones.
There are more people dependent on tax-extorted from the few productive people the country still has working in the private sector or for themselves. 
Every government service and state-owned entity has failed, or is on its way there.  The country is experiencing blackouts and water restrictions. I am not aware of any municipality, bar from a few managed by the opposition party, that is performing well.
Every tertiary institution is marred by corruption scandals, if not another scandal that destabilizes the learning objective.
The probability of dying at the hospital or clinic that is supposed to save you is as real as the fact that the formal schools that were supposed to teach have left people dumber and unemployed/ unemployable. Despite boasting the most educated generation, the country is still plagued by numerous social ills.
The above are just a few key highlights from a long list of problems. Politicians who supported these ideas and their advisors have moved on to higher positions, despite the negative long-term consequences we are experiencing now.
The formal schooling system has subjected each of us to horrendous experiences that have greatly influenced my approach to educating my children. Given the limited options within the system, I felt compelled to explore alternative avenues to provide a promising future for my children.
I am not saying that the path I have chosen will work for everyone, and I am also not saying that the formal schooling system has no successes. The prevalence of such arrogance is what has led us to adopt a uniform approach that has taken advantage of taxpayers, caused children to feel insufficient because they couldn't meet an absurd standard that held no relevance to their future success, and produced grown-ups lacking fundamental abilities required to sustain oneself, which is the ultimate benchmark of maturity.
As someone who successfully graduated from the formal schooling system and managed to achieve positive outcomes in adulthood, even after attending some of the lowest ranked schools, one might assume that I hold a favourable view of formal education. There is absolutely no denying the fact that my positive outcomes cannot be attributed to the formal schooling system.
It dawned on me that if these results were mostly a product of the formal schooling system, they should be the norm rather than exception. All children who have completed the same level of education should achieve similar outcomes, given that the curriculum is standardized and they all have formal schooling as the constant. Yet nothing could be further from the truth, variation is the rule.
The accomplishments that individuals achieve in adulthood are as varied as the distinctiveness of families. If the formal education system fails to make a significant impact on the successful outcomes individuals achieve as adults, how can we reasonably claim that it is a universal solution for everyone?
I couldn't bear to expose my children to a system that has resulted in a once hopeful nation becoming a backward state in a freefall.
Although I was exposed to brainwashing and indoctrination during my time in school, it was ultimately the teachings and genetic inheritance from my parents that truly shaped the trajectory of my life.
The moment I recognized that my achievements in life were not due to school, but rather in spite of it, was the moment I began seeking alternative opportunities for my family.
	




Part 1: Why










		

1. The formal school system
8.3 The character of home education
Home education:
is the oldest form of child education;
precedes formal school education in all cultures;
represents and honours a preference or wish of a parent to personally facilitate the education of her or his child in the family home.
exposes the learner to the knowledge, skills and values required for:
admission to further education and training, higher education and/or employment; and
life as an active community member and citizen of the modern world.
allows for:
flexibility of learning provision, guided self-study and the use of a variety of media.
access to a varied array of public amenities (like libraries and museums), commercially available learning programmes (online and otherwise) and tutorial assistance.
networking amongst parents for the sharing of experiences, mutual encouragement and support.
Parents who home educate their children place high premium on resource-rich learning e.g.:
experimentation with the ever-widening learning opportunities in the environment,
use of resources in print, DVDs and the Internet, and
encouraging holistic learning from the child’s family, social, cultural, religious and physical environments
Policy on Home Education. Government Gazette No. 42037 – 16 November 2018.
According to South African History Online (SAHO), the first formal school in South Africa was opened by the Dutch East India Company on 17 April 1658. Until then, the education of the child was the primary responsibility of the family with the immediate community also contributing. The Department of Basic Education (DBE) has officially recognized and declared this as an indisputable truth in their Education Policy.
Children learned from their families, including their peers, mostly through informal learning the following amongst others;
Their role in the family's wellbeing,
Looking after livestock,
Tradition and culture,
Subsistence farming,
Building of dwellings,
Hunting and gathering,
Offensive and defensive fighting strategies,
Cooking, cleaning and general housekeeping,
The difference between poisonous and medicinal plants
The children were fortunate to be exposed to a diverse range of skills within their family and immediate community. The development of these skills was not only vital for their survival but was also transmitted by family and community members who were deeply committed to the child's nourishment.
The parents, family and immediate community’s incentive to educate the children was not based on monetary rewards. It was rather an authentic interest in the child learning practical skills that they needed to be a productive member of the family and community. If parents, families and communities did not teach children necessary skills to survive, the parents would suffer the consequences in their old age. Children collecting wild fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants needed to know which were safe for consumption to avoid poisoning themselves and their family. If the food was consumed at a celebration or mourning attended by the whole community, all of them could suffer the consequences.  
The success or failure of a child had tangible consequences that affected not only their family, but also the wider community. It was a practical concern that went beyond being just a theoretical concept. The child was not reduced to a mere statistical abstract, as politicians, bureaucrats, and advocates for centralized education tend to do. 
Now this is not to say there were no formal institutions then, albeit in a different format than we currently have. As a Xhosa man for example I’ve had to go through initiation school which was meant to prepare me for manhood. The practice has a formal nature, defined by its own set of norms, traditions, and structure. Its ultimate goal was to provide me as I transitioned to manhood with a comprehensive education on what it means to be a man. 
“Ulwaluko is a Xhosa word that refers to an initiation ritual that is performed to transform boys into men (Goniwe, 2004). This has been practised for more than a thousand years (Mtumane, 2004) among the Xhosa, an indigenous tribe predominantly residing in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa.
The ritual begins with the seclusion of the initiate (one who undergoes the cultural circumcision ritual) from his immediate surroundings to a temporary hut built of grass (Turner, 1995). 
At this hut, he is circumcised (male circumcision is the partial or full removal of the foreskin of the penis) (Hellsten, 2004) and receives instructions on courtship, social responsibility, marriage practices (Goniwe, 2004), sexual education (Vincent, 2008a), and adult life and its responsibilities (Pauw, 1994). 
Finally, the initiate is welcomed back into the community and the ritual concludes with a celebration of his newly acquired manhood status (Mavundla, Netswera, Bottoman, & Toth, 2009).”

Granted not much can be learned in a month but that was all the time I could spend there, formal schooling demanded I return on time for my final year in tertiary. My elders used to frown on how the practice has now been reduced to almost a token, even the time spent there has to be shortened to prioritise formal schooling/ employment. 
Similarly, with one of the greatest military forces to ever come out of the continent, Shaka, had a formal system to train his warriors. Although training for children was often unstructured, there were still formal educational systems in place to teach certain skills at specific ages.
The introduction of formal schools started mostly with missionary schools in the country, eventually morphing to the multitude of school types we currently have. Today there are many types of schools, from public to private and hybrids in between. 

Public vs Private Schools 
The public or private status of a school is determined by its funding, and subsequent ownership. Public schools, also known as government schools, are primarily funded by the taxpayers while private schools are paid for by the individual parents. 
The public schools catering to those with the least financial means require no fees with all costs paid for by the taxpayer. These, according to the education department are classified as quantile 1 - 3 schools. These schools have an obligation to admit all children without entrance evaluations nor financial barriers. 
Public schools catering to parents in the higher end of the wealth spectrum compete with the best private schools due to most of their funding coming from parents. Quintile 4 schools receive some financial support from taxpayers, but when it comes to quintile 5 schools, the expenses are primarily covered by parents themselves and can be just as costly as elite private schools. 
Private schools are funded and run independent of the government, although there is a Constitutional provision for them to be registered with the government. They range in size and are often best when parents want to educate their children in line with their religion as these can discriminate legally. They can also admit children subject to them passing an entrance evaluation and confirmation the parents will be able to pay the fees.
I have categorized both quantile 5 and private schools as Premium Schools. These schools charge a higher price because they claim to provide excellent education.
Public or private, the stated purpose of these schools is to educate. 
The formal education model involves attending a specific facility with established schedules for class time, structured tasks, and a set curriculum. Remote Learning (same as Distance Education/ Distance Learning) is a viable alternative that historically benefited working adults who were far from educational institutions but still aspired to advance their studies. 
In the past, remote learning used to depend on the postal service for sending study materials to students. Likewise, students used to communicate with the school through regular mail to submit their assignments.
The internet revolutionized remote learning by making correspondence much faster and allowing for live attendance in remote classes. This has enabled some traditional schools to offer their content while the learners are at home, irrespective of age.
Traditional Schools vs Distant Education vs Homeschooling
It's crucial to emphasize that traditional and online schools differ solely in their mode of delivery, but their substance remains identical. Traditional schools have evolved to offer some of their classes online as was seen during the 2020 lockdowns where school premises could not be accessed.
Online schooling, or remote learning, is not homeschooling. While the student learns from home, or anywhere for that matter as long as they have access to their study material, they still follow the school's fixed curriculum. They have to adhere to the school’s calendar and daily class schedule. Parents have the same level of participation in online learning as they would in traditional schools, where teachers are responsible for teaching, evaluating, and grading.
A home school is probably the last step before homeschooling. A home school is not home schooling as it is also based on the formal education model with a curriculum often necessary. The parent adheres to the grading and assessment model with the primary difference being that they are the ones in charge of this instead of the teacher. 
With homeschooling the parent is the teacher thus, has a larger role to play. The parent has more flexibility in terms of the curriculum. There are many resources available online to assist the parent in their role, including retailers that sell all the material the parent requires, such as;
Learning material.
Assessment and evaluation material.
Recorded or live classes.
Using a curriculum helps reduce the parent's workload and provides important guidance, especially as a soft landing from a traditional school, enroute to homeschooling.  
Traditional schools are criticized for not recognizing each individual's unique abilities due to their standardized approach. This is where the eclectic curriculum comes in.
The curriculum is individualised, extremely flexible and uses a combination of methods to teach. Before getting to where I am I had to start somewhere, this curriculum is flexible enough that I can change if something doesn't work. There is no one size fits all for the children, the one that likes doing is taught through practical experience while the academic inclined or the one that enjoys the computer will have their learning biased that way.
I am a firm believer no one knows more about a child than their parents and family. The eclectic curriculum embraces this because with multiple family members in the house, each of our children are likely to be similar to at least one of us, thus making that person the ideal teacher for that child. This even if it's just for one activity as we can switch at will.
Just like a child resembles their parents and other kin in looks, the same also applies to personalities as certain traits are just as inheritable, albeit in different degrees. This means if one observes their child there are certain qualities they will exhibit from their parents, which then could be used to infer how the child is likely to learn. 
Shouldn't the parents and family be in charge of the curriculum since parents and family members can assess the child's abilities not only based on upbringing but also through genetics and their own abilities?

2. Why I got started
“More than 80 percent of South Africa’s grade 4 pupils – who are on average nine or 10 years old – cannot read for meaning. That means they can’t answer basic questions about or draw inferences from a text they’re reading. This worrying statistic emerged from the 2021 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), which were released by the country’s basic education minister, Angie Motshekga, on 16 May.”
The Conversation, May 2023

Amongst the many revelations in 2023, which dominated the headlines was the dismal state of reading ability amongst the country’s children, most of whom attend tax funded public schools. Media outlets, both local and international, featured this article prominently. This bleak picture was revealed by the PIRLS 2021 International Results in Reading conducted by the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Centre. Since 1969, the Centre has been comparing student achievement in math, science, and reading in over 60 countries through regular assessments called TIMSS and PIRLS.
The Centre aims to help countries make better decisions about education policy based on evidence. Although the data provided by the Center is intended for governments, it can still be used by individuals, particularly parents with school-aged children, to assess the performance of the formal schooling/ education system.
Predictably the minister of basic education didn't take full accountability, despite having been in the position since 2009. The school closures during the Covid-19 lockdowns, along with other factors such as significant historical obstacles like poverty, inequality, and inadequate infrastructure, were all responsible for the situation according to the minister. 
The problem however is that this has been the trend for the past couple of years, at least dating as far back as the day she was appointed into office. A similar study in 2016 placed South African last amongst the countries surveyed, the same position achieved in 2021.
It is undeniable that the ruling party, to which she belongs, must finally recognize that they have held power for a considerable period of time and take responsibility for overcoming these so-called "historical obstacles."

2.1. Problems with the Formal School System
One doesn’t need to review academic research to see the problems plaguing the formal school system that are leading up to this crisis. Corruption is a widespread issue across the nation, leading to the misappropriation of taxpayer-funded resources away from schools and benefiting private individuals. Newly built infrastructure is often of poor quality. Some buildings start to fall apart before they are finished or handed over to the client by the contractor. 
In addition to the challenges already faced by the education system, South Africa also grapples with other societal problems such as crime, urban migration, load shedding, and illegal immigration to mention a few. These issues further exacerbate the difficulties encountered in the education sector.
The consequences are reflected in the employability of the graduates, be it matric or tertiary. In 2023, South Africa's youth unemployment rate was unacceptably high with more than 60 percent of the youth of working age without employment. The ‘lack of reading comprehension’ has been identified by the Department of Higher Education as “the Number 1 skill deficit in the country’s labour market”. 
It is paradoxical that the Department of Basic Education claims, as per its vision, that it “aims for a future where every citizen of South Africa can acquire knowledge and skills throughout their lives, which will ultimately lead to a better standard of living and a harmonious, prosperous, and democratic society.”
The tax funded formal school system has wasted taxpayer money, kept children away from their families, indoctrinated people to hate others on the basis of immutable characteristics or cumulative efforts of their ancestors, and caused the country to regress. It should have been a warning from the beginning, of the detrimental effects of the institution, when attendance of a formal school was presented as though it was mandatory.
Why would one need to be forced to do what is good for them? No laws have ever been required to compel people to eat or breathe, all living entities instinctively know this and do it. Rather than people wasting because they are not eating, obesity is a problem in prosperous countries. Laws are enacted to restrict eating certain foods because all living entities know nutrition is necessary, thus always seek it.  
What most don’t know however is that the compulsory status was achieved by a legislative sleight of hand. The Constitution of South Africa, which is the most supreme law in the land, makes no reference to formal schooling as being the only means to provide basic education, nor does it define basic education. Defining education to mean formal education was only done in the legislation subordinate to the Constitution. While government officials can enact legislation to give effect to the provisions of the Constitution, said legislation is never superior to the empowering provision in the Constitution.


2.2. Premium public schools and private schools are the solution, right?
“According to an IRR statement issued last week, the “race hustler consultancies” that are springing up are exaggerating the extent of racism in schools and businesses to “win contracts to address this allegedly ubiquitous crisis”. The IRR intends to expose all these “hustlers”.”
John Kane-Berman

The “unsubstantiated insistence that racism is the biggest problem” flies in the face of no fewer than seven nation-wide opinion surveys commissioned by the South African Institute of Race Relations (IRR) over the past 20 years. Race issues were a concern for only 8 percent of South Africans in 2001 and only 3.3 percent last year. Unemployment, crime, living conditions, and poor education have long been of far greater concern.
Many parents with the material means may think that prestigious quintile 5 schools and private schools are the logical next step after considering public schools, especially fully taxpayer-funded no fee ones. However, things may not be as straightforward as they seem.
I used to firmly believe that prestigious schools, which encompasses both private schools and top-tier quantile 5 public schools with impressive graduation rates, held a clear advantage over lower-quality no fee public schools. That was, until Dr Thomas Sowell introduced me to the sorting function of the formal schooling system and the unfair advantage prestigious schools have since they can pick and choose who they admit.
From the outset they can choose to admit students of a certain intellect thus increasing the chances of these students performing favourably relative to no fee public schools that have an obligation to admit everyone. Parents who can afford to send their child to private school are usually more involved and provide more resources for their child to succeed. The ability of parents to afford the prohibitively high costs of the schools is also an indicator of the child’s abilities since his parents had it in them to work hard enough to earn what enabled them to afford a prestigious school.
Once you have factored those aspects as a minimum, the prestigious school’s performance doesn’t seem that great. As long as the parents have resources to support the child’s learning environment, the type of school a child attends becomes less relevant. This is why the quantile 5 public schools perform at the level of private schools. As the level of the parent’s material wealth increases such that more educational resources can be availed to the child, so does the performance of a child. This, of course happens to a certain level as the law of diminishing return eventually kicks in.
In recent years, prestigious schools have faced accusations of racial discrimination, leading to expensive investigations that have ultimately failed to uncover any proof of such allegations. Richard Wilkinson has been amongst the individuals investigating this grift on the website school-capture.com. Individuals who present themselves as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion experts, under the influence and guidance of their American counterparts, are diluting the competitive advantage that these schools have over the public sector. Although allegations of racism caused class disruptions and the grifters were already paid, no evidence could be found to support their claims, as is the case with any scam.
Although public and private education may vary, they are both affected by the declining socio-economic circumstances and affirmative action policies. Previously, prestigious schools could distinguish themselves by selecting teachers and employees based on merit, but now all sectors are subject to the country's race-based labour laws. In both public and private schools, merit is no longer the primary criteria for the job, as race and gender have to be taken into account instead.
This national policy impediment is not only confined to the recruitment phase but throughout the employment of the person. In the past, simply demonstrating an employee's incompetence was sufficient reason to terminate them and recruit a more capable individual to fill the position. It's hard to fire bad teachers because of legal consequences that can hurt the school's resources.
The case for prestigious schools being the better alternative to public schools was also shredded by my own experience. I went to no fee public schools throughout my schooling life, starting in Transkei until I matriculated in Mpumalanga in 1999. The first school I attended didn’t have classrooms for all students, so we literally studied under a tree at times. This trend of going to inadequately resourced schools continued until high school but thankfully improved for the better. When one of the primary schools close to home didn’t have enough classrooms, the community was kind enough to avail two churches for the purpose. Kiriyatswane, the high school I attended went from prefabricated buildings to a fully constructed building by the time I left.
It is evident that the schools I went to were lacking in resources not only for housing but also in other aspects of education which were easily accessible by prestigious schools. If prestigious schools truly provide such an advantage in one's academic and professional development, then my achievements and overall success in life should not be comparable with those of any individual who had the advantage of attending such schools. Nothing could be further from the truth as my experience has revealed.
Between myself and my friends amongst others, who also attended ‘resource poor’ public schools we do well enough to have risen to own at least one property in a good neighbourhood. We attained the credentials that subsequently earned prestigious careers for the duration we opted to remain in the formal employment sector, for those of us who chose otherwise. 
At 40 years old I could afford to take a break from formal employment to spend more time with my family, a luxury my father and grandfathers couldn’t have dreamed of, even for their descendants. 
I am successful and content with my life, as is the case for my brethren.
Success, of course, is relative. So unless one finds anchors against which to measure it, the word is meaningless. 
My father is my primary role model. Being able to measure up to him was my greatest aspiration as a child. I have not only achieved this, but I have also surpassed his accomplishments in every way, except for raising a son who can do the same as me. That is work in progress. 
I not only achieved a level of quality of life that is experienced by very few people in the population, but I also did it for my mother, sisters, and their children.
Attending a prestigious school fails dismally as an absolute advantage when experience is considered. If it was, then everyone, or most people who went to such schools would be more successful than myself and other people who went to no fee public schools. This is not the case. 
While I may not have recorded my life, with relatable documentary programs like 7Up South Africa, I might as well have. Amongst many lessons, the show inadvertently shows the futility of the hype behind prestigious schools 
Considering I not only went to public schools but grossly under-resourced public schools, my progress and outcomes in life should never be comparable to those of someone who went to a prestigious school.
You would think this makes the case for public schools being better, but nothing could be further from the truth. If my success is due to the public schools I attended, then most people who attended similar or better public schools should have achieved comparable success to me at worst, with most doing better in line with the classification of the schools they attended.
As most people who've been to school in the country have been to public schools, South Africa would be a first world country if most public-school graduates managed to progress as I did. Even with South Africa's increasing investment in public schools, the majority of graduates still struggle to find employment, ultimately relying on a limited number of taxpayers for support.
What led to my progress if my attendance at a public school didn't hold me back and my lack of prestigious school education didn't hinder my success? In other words, what caused some individuals to succeed while others did not, despite attending the same or similar public schools?
The day I found out the answer to this question was the day I decided to take charge of my sons’ education.

3. Does the formal schooling system make sense at least?
“You are yet to catch up with the real world if you’ve never studied any concepts outside the school syllabus or read any books beside the texts books school forced you to read. Most people are just programmed not educated”
Nicky Verd

I want to say I hated school as a child, but somehow that would imply I had the luxury to have a feeling towards something as sacrosanct. Going to school was as fundamental as breathing is, as such it was beyond questioning.  
It was not something you could afford to have an opinion towards; you just had to do it. Your life depended on it, literally, just like inhaling and exhaling!
If God made heaven and earth, it was as natural and expected that school was as highly held! Incidentally, religion was just as beyond questioning as school was!
When I reflect on my school days, I realize that I now have the freedom to express my opinions about my experiences. This ability comes with the benefit of hindsight, as in the past I did not have the luxury to do so.
Now that I can question though, I am, and have been for some time now. I realised I didn’t like school. Ironically, if you were to review my transcripts you’d think otherwise. The reality though is that I performed well so that I didn’t have to be there longer than I had to. From as young as I can remember, I have always been more comfortable at home than elsewhere. School as such was more akin to torture, but for the learning.

3.1. Things that don’t make sense about formal schooling
I enjoyed going to school to learn the academic subjects we didn’t have the resources for at home, but everything else didn’t make sense.
Is the rigid, one size fits all model the most efficient way to deliver education to the multitudes of different learners?
While my parents endeavoured to find us a house closer to the school in the village, sometimes this was impossible. This only proved beneficial for two years in primary school but for the rest of the years I had to traverse through multiple villages to get to school. 
There were no readily available vehicles to ferry us so for the majority we walked the large distances to school, while lugging heavy backpacks with our books and necessities. This meant early mornings, in freezing winter or rainy summers, traversing long distances laden with hazards to get to school on time. For most of my schooling I was a consumer with the teacher providing the lessons and model answers for exams. 
Just like behaviour, answers to test questions didn’t need to be correct, but conform to expectation. Seldom was critical thinking encouraged, because it deviated from the hierarchy and expected responses. Questioning the correctness of the content of the lessons and school methods was akin to questioning the will of God.  

Are compulsory physical activities and sports at school justified?
Is it worth investing significant time and resources into sports and physical activities, taking into account that only a select few can actually turn it into a sustainable career that offers financial stability? Sports and physical activities are only beneficial for a few people who enjoy them. For most people, mandating these activities is a waste of valuable time and precious resources. 
I used to walk sometimes four kilometres to school, then I had to walk the same distance after school to go to the river and fetch water for our home. Not only that, but there was also an abundance of physical tasks at home that completely drained me, especially considering that I was the only male child in the family. Considering I neither needed the exercise nor enjoyed sports I fail to see why I had to endure this waste of time. 
Fighting, even amongst boys of the same village, was also frequent, if not customary. Fridays, after cleaning the school, were known to be for fighting. It helped if there had been a disagreement between some boys during the week to heighten the anticipation, but it was not necessary. In the absence of authentic disagreements, the older boys would just pick who would fight whom just for entertainment. Alternatively, we played games like ‘The Battery’ to catalyse the start of a fight. If the argument for sport was to help young boys dispose of their violent competing tendencies in a controlled manner, my experience proved otherwise.
One of the main roles of schools is to provide child-care services, enabling the parents to dedicate themselves to formal work. Without the school system, parents would need to give up their jobs in the formal sector, ultimately diminishing the family's overall quality of life. However, this defence is quite feeble, especially in 2023, as some provinces of the country are grappling with a disproportionate number of unemployed residents in contrast to the employed ones. It is even more discouraging to think that in previous generations, especially in rural areas, the majority of families relied exclusively on a single source of income. 
The arrangement where one parent stayed at home to care for the children while the other parent went out to earn the family's income proved incredibly advantageous for the wellbeing and development of the children. My grandfathers were both able to provide for their families on their single incomes, while my grandmothers and step-grandmothers chose to dedicate themselves to being homemakers instead of seeking formal employment. Despite this supposed impediment, my grandfathers successfully raised approximately a dozen children each, most of whom grew up to be adults. Many of these children started their families. 
Despite receiving a higher level of education and both parents being formally employed, each successive generation has been gradually having fewer children. Later generations have become increasingly poor due to lack of formal job opportunities. In certain circumstances, when both parents are committed to formal employment, the assistance of external surrogates, like teachers, becomes necessary. We are now witnessing the repercussions of this situation, as the generation that experienced minimal parental involvement, being replaced by teachers, now grapples with the challenges of becoming independent.
Most of all though, is the time that could be spent with parents but instead sacrificed to school justified? This was the biggest driver for me, especially since my father died when I was 11. It’s one thing that the time he was alive he often had to work far and come home on weekends, any other time he was available but during the week was lost to school. Then, after he died, I had to leave home and the only parent I still have, under the guise amongst other things of better education.
It was for these reasons that I decided to look a little deeper into schooling, especially as a prerequisite to having a child. It didn’t make sense to subject my children to the same miserable conditions because I was supposed to or that’s how the majority does it. The performance of school-leavers after 1994 also highlighted the detrimental institutions most of us were subjecting our children to.
3.2. At least the formal schooling system educates people, right? 
If we were to acknowledge that our progress in formal schooling shapes our identity and determines our future, as it is said by the advocates of formal schooling, it would suggest that every individual who has completed their schooling, such as high school, would achieve similar or at least comparable outcomes, considering they have gone through the same curriculum. There would be a lower limit for those who went to the poorest public schools, just like those who went to expensive public private schools would have comparable outcomes at the top. Either way, people who went to school would have similar, or at least comparable outcomes.
This is far from what one sees when looking at reality, in the positive direction at least. 
School, despite being the constant for most people, is seldom the determiner of how better off, or worse off people are. Although it might seem logical to assume that people who attended similar schools would have similar outcomes, or at least comparable ones, the reality couldn't be further from the truth!
If formal schooling doesn't determine people's outcomes, why do we invest so much time and resources in it? Why do we sacrifice time which, as parents, we can never get back with our kids just so they can go to school? How and when did we start thinking like this?
 In 2023, the situation might be even more dire for the ‘born free’ generation. A considerable number of individuals from the post 1994 generation have not only completed primary and high school successfully, but they have also chosen to further their education at the tertiary level. One would expect this to lead to higher success rates compared to previous generations who had less schooling. 
This is not the case, this generation, with quantitatively more schooling, is actually doing worse than their predecessors. Some people have become perpetual children to the taxpayer and their parents. They are encountering high levels of unemployment and as a result, relying more and more on government-funded support. Parents are seldom looking forward to their old age because they have to work longer or have their retirement income provide for both their kids and grandchildren.



4. Historical background of the formal schooling system
“In sum, for several thousand years after the advent of agriculture, the education of children was, to a considerable degree, a matter squashing their wilfulness in order to make them good laborers. 
A good child was an obedient child, who suppressed his or her urge to play and explore and dutifully carried out the orders of adult masters. Such education, fortunately, was never fully successful. The human instincts to play and explore are so powerful that they can never be fully beaten out of a child. But the philosophy of education throughout that period, to the degree that it could be articulated, was the opposite of the philosophy that hunter-gatherers had held for hundreds of thousands of years earlier.”
Peter Gray, Ph.D.

Growing up in a culture with common practices like religion and education can make it seem like they are ‘normal’. It can make one think that this is just the way things are and have always been. This then elevates these topics to a status that seems beyond questioning, as if they are sacrosanct. 
Although these practices may not appear problematic at first, the true issue becomes evident when faced with the immense and far-reaching damage they cause in the long term.
It's no surprise that I have dedicated a significant portion of my free time to reading and diving into documentaries that illuminate these subjects. I have been captivated and enlightened by both of them.
While I might not have appreciated history as a subject, I do now. I love the context I’ve managed to get by looking back to how things were. There is nothing I have found more relevant in informing my future than a glimpse into my family’s past. Then beyond my immediate I looked into my community, and the rest of humanity. I’m fortunate in 2023 to have an opportunity to explore the captivating works of the writers who, long before my own civilization, pioneered the practice of documenting and preserving their records.

4.1. Where and when did it all start?
There is a multitude of literature on the subject because tracing the origins of the current schooling system is a subject on its own. I will not pretend to cover even a fraction of the history, but will instead highlight the aspects I consider relevant for this small book. The crucial aspect of history in relation to the education system lies in understanding the influential factors that have shaped it into what it is today: a standardized factory model that produces compliant individuals, stifling their creativity. I am one of those people. 
The model used locally is consistent with the rest of the West’s, so I will briefly mention the South African specifics.  
It is not a coincidence that I have mentioned education and religion, the connection between the two has existed for millennia. History traces the first formal schools to 3000 BC by the Sumerians and Egyptians. The express purpose was to teach students to read and write the different writing systems the two cultures had developed. By about 1000 BC, priests were teaching the sacred Hebrew writings in religious schools in Syria. These however were limited to the upper classes that had both resources and free time to spend on formal education. Confucius, who lived between 551 and 479 BC is credited with the first schools that were opened to everyone, not just the privileged few.
With the increasing number of individuals abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, the demand for education not only grew, but also became a necessity. Agriculture demands individuals capable of toiling the land and engaging in manual labour that is often strenuous and monotonous. This stands in stark contrast to the hunter-gatherer way of life, where people solely rely on the provisions of nature.  
Naturally, children had to be taught so that they could perform this labour, according to Peter Gray, Ph.D.  “The principal lessons that children had to learn were obedience, suppression of their own will, and the show of reverence toward lords and masters. A rebellious spirit could well result in death.” The rise of the industrial age further increased the need for suitable labour that was docile and obedient.

4.2. Authentic beginnings to nefarious execution 
“First of all, the kinds of people attracted to the original insurgency, under the initial set of incentives and constraints, tend to be very different from the kinds of people who gravitate to it after it has become successful and achieved a major part of its goals. By definition, an insurgent movement forms under a set of incentives and constraints very different from those which it seeks to create. Often the members face a certain amount of hostility, or even persecution, from those around them or from an elite currently benefitting from the status quo. These original insurgents may even face dangers to their careers or to their lives. These are not conditions which tend to attract timid careerists or the opportunists, unless the opportunists foresee a high probability that the insurgency will succeed within a period of time that is relevant to their personal ambitions.”
Thomas Sowell, Knowledge and Decisions

It is important to recognize the need for formal education in certain areas and the benefits that we have gained from it. While I have criticized the formal schooling system and its changes over time, there is evidence to show that the original goal of creating a structured education system was sincere. Unfortunately, some people saw it as an opportunity to manipulate and benefit themselves, causing it to deviate from its original purpose.
“What began as a mission to improve the environment for the sake of humanity became a political movement in which humanity became the villain and hard science a non-issue.” This is Patric Moore’s personal account on PragerU. He takes us through the reasons why, despite being one of the original founders, he decided to leave Greenpeace. The initially well-meaning endeavour was eventually hijacked by malicious individuals whose motivations revolved around their own personal gains rather than the original purpose of the mission. The same has happened to the formal schooling system. 
Martin Luther was a German priest who lived between 1483 and 1546. He played a crucial role in implementing and spreading compulsory education in Europe. According to him, the bible was the only source of divinely revealed knowledge. Luther made the Bible easier for people to understand by translating it into a commonly spoken German dialect. For people to be able to read the bible, Luther advocated for the implementation of public schooling. 
I don't need to believe in the Bible to respect someone who wanted to empower people to discover what they considered the truth on their own. The Pope and Archbishop, exploiting the vulnerability of those who couldn't read the Bible, used their own interpretation to their advantage, while the church's wealth was ever-increasing. Luther sincerely was trying to address this.
In the 17th century, Germany passed laws that required children to go to school, which were operated by the Lutheran church. 
It is of little coincidence that Germany had a tax funded education system in the 18th century considering Luther was German. The purpose of the system was to mould a citizenry to be obedient, loyal to the country while also teaching basic reading, writing and math. This model apparently had so much success that American educators adopted it in the 19th century. Massachusetts was the first in America to mandate schooling in the 17th century. The UK National Archives date the implementation of mandatory schooling to the early 1900s.
The success of the industrial age also required a workforce that was even more suited for the factory. In his insightful article "The Ugly Truth About the Education System You Were Never Told," Anoop Abraham exposes the malevolent motives and individuals lurking behind the educational establishment. In the early 1900’s what eventually became the model of the formal school system which is standard in most government mandates actually had its roots in the private sector. Instead of striving to cultivate an enlightened and educated society, the industrialists sought to establish a workforce that would obediently conform and refrain from questioning those in power.
The General Education Board, a private institution, created in America in 1902, was started with funding from John D. Rockefeller. One of the original board members was Frederick T. Gates
Andrew Carnegie, another highly successful and wealthy American industrialist, also played a major role in shaping the school system. His financial support to education made him a revered philanthropist. However, it is important to note that all this funding did not come without strings attached. These conditions played a crucial role in shaping the education system according to Carnegie's visionary perspective.
The role of the government would become more prominent over the next decades with the tax funded public school system. By the 1930s American states mandated laws to compel children to attend school.
“In our dream we have limitless resources, and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hand. The present educational conventions fade from our minds; and, unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or of science. We are not to raise up among them authors, orators, poets, or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians. Nor will we cherish even the humbler ambition to raise up from among them lawyers, doctors, preachers, statesmen, of whom we now have ample supply.”
- Rev. Frederick T. Gates, Board Member, The General Education Board. 


4.3. Formal schooling in South Africa
“It is the policy of my department that education should have its roots entirely in the Native areas and in the Native environment and Native community. 
There Bantu education must be able to give itself complete expression and there it will have to perform its real service. 
The Bantu must be guided to serve his own community in all respects. 
There is no place for him in the European community above the level of certain forms of labour. 
Within his own community, however, all doors are open.”
Dr Hendrik Verwoerd, then South African minister for native affairs,

There is no evidence of formal schooling in the country before the establishment of the Dutch Cape Colony. The people that occupied the area now called South Africa taught their children through informal means. A possible explanation for this is that the San and Khoikhoi people, who were the earliest inhabitants, followed by the Bantu, were not as affected by religious influences which were driving the need for formal education in other parts of the world.
The Dutch East India Company created South Africa's first school in 1658. After that, the Christian church also had a significant impact on education, similar to other westernised countries. By 1663, the second school opened, and unsurprisingly the teacher was a church clerk, Ernestus Back. 
Attendance of formal schools was first mandated in 1682. According to SAHO all slave children had to attend school twice a week. Schools were introduced, but settlers and slaves were not interested and found clever ways to avoid going to them. In 1714, a committee to oversee education, the Scholarchs, was established with 3 church ministers and a civil servant. 
It was not until 1795 that education became a state function. This however did not eliminate the role of the church as Christian missionaries continued to establish schools. It was only in 1804, with the passing of The School ordinance that the state took full control of public education from the church.
In the coming years, more schools will be constructed. Public schools will serve white children, while the church will play a crucial role in educating Black South Africans. Wynberg Boys School was established in the 1820s. After that, more schools were built in other provinces of the country, including the Orange Free State and the former Ciskei. Over the next few years more schools would open, including colleges. 
The state acknowledged the significance of the missionary schools, granting them state subsidies in 1841 and continuing financial support in 1854 under the leadership of Governor Sir George Grey of the Cape. In the late 18th century, the school system went through policy changes to formalize and standardize it. Funding directives were also established for different institutions.
The country's first democratically elected president and leader of the African National Congress later went to a mission school. Nelson Mandela joined the Clarkebury Mission School when he was 15 and also went to Healdtown Mission Institute. 
“At a time when the government took no interest whatsoever in our education, it was the church-founded schools who educated us, and conscientised us to the unjust realities of South African society” 
– Nelson Mandela
In 1948, the National Party came into power after winning the general elections. This would have a major impact on the formal schooling system. The Eiselen Commission Report in 1951 provided recommendations to the government on how to segregate people based on race in the formal schooling system, in line with the National Party's Apartheid campaign slogan and election promise. The Apartheid system of government divided people into four racial groups: Black, White, Indians and Coloureds.
Dr Hendrik Verwoerd, who was the Minister of Native Affairs at the time, introduced the Bantu Education Act in 1953. This led to the creation of the Department of Bantu Education. Between 1953 and 1967 separate education systems were set up for Blacks, Coloured and Whites with the Education Act passed. These laws limited school access based on race and penalized both the individuals who disobeyed them and the schools that accepted those individuals.
“The act required Black children to attend the government schools. Teaching was to take place in the students’ native tongue, though the syllabus included classes in English and Afrikaans. Instruction was mandated in needlework (for girls), handcraft, planting, and soil conservation as well as in arithmetic, social studies, and Christian religion. The education was aimed at training the children for the manual labour and menial jobs that the government deemed suitable for those of their race, and it was explicitly intended to inculcate the idea that Black people were to accept being subservient to white South Africans. Funding for the schools was to come from taxes paid by the communities that they served, so Black schools received only a small fraction of the amount of money that was available to their white counterparts.”
-      Bauer, Pat. "Bantu Education Act". Encyclopedia Britannica, 10 June. 2023, https://www.britannica.com/event/Bantu-Education-Act. Accessed 16 November 2023.
 
The segregation was not confined to schools but extended to institutions of higher learning. Black students were prohibited from attending white universities after the implementation of the Extension of University Education Act, Act 45 of 1959. 
University of Fort Hare, Vista to mention some were formed for Blacks.
Despite the demise of missionary schools, eventually more black people attended formal schooling. This was to keep up with the demand for a trained labour force that made the government increase its investment in black schools. Initially, black people were required to attend high school in their homelands, but this changed in 1972 to accommodate workforce needs.
One of the most prominent apartheid symbols of this country is a picture of the lifeless body of Hector Pieterson being carried by a fellow student after he was killed by the police. Around 10,000 students protested the apartheid government's education policies. They marched on 16 June 1976 to oppose being required to study in Afrikaans.
“As apartheid police responded to the march with force, the protest turned violent. By the end of the day, around 176 young people had been killed and thousands more injured when police fired live ammunition into the crowd. Thirteen-year-old Hector Pieterson was one of the first to die. A photograph of his limp body being carried by a fellow student, flanked by his sister Antoinette Sithole, has come to immortalise this bleak day in South African history.”

The formal school system was used as a tool to entrench division in this country. White schools were better resourced than Indian, Coloured, and Black schools, which led to them being seen as superior. In post-apartheid South Africa, the ability to afford these prestigious schools has become a symbol of status, showcasing the material success of parents. Living closer to the school is seen as having higher status, because these areas used to be occupied predominantly by white people, excluding other races. However, this doesn't diminish the efforts of families in townships who still manage to send their children to these schools. Unfortunately, sometimes there are negative perceptions surrounding this situation.
In South Africa, the school system, similar to America, was also utilized to promote nefarious agendas, particularly the separation of people based on race. The unequal distribution of resources between black and white schools made black students feel inferior. There was a sense of resentment among some black students towards their fellow peers from the township who attended prestigious schools, which occasionally resulted in negative outcomes.
“Lunga - It was about five to eight, I had an argument with this guy. He says he’s going to beat me up, and I told him to come. And while I was talking to him one of his older friends who was like behind me, hit me with a bottle and I lost consciousness, and when I came, when I woke up, I was here, in the hospital. And then I started having seizures, then I passed out again. I woke up in bed.
Interviewer – Where did he hit you?
Lunga – On the back of the head.
Interviewer – What was the argument about?
Lunga - He claims, that I’m asking out his sister, and I told him that wasn’t true. And then his friend say, I think I’m better than him because I go to a white school, and stuff like that”

5. The real purpose of the formal education system, as measured by actual results
“One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results.
Milton Friedman”

There has never been a generation in this country as highly schooled as the post 1994 generation. Ironically, the same generation is still dependent on their less schooled parents who have to provide for them and grandchildren. While in the past it may have been tempting to accept the statements of proponents of formal schooling and politicians at face value due to the lack of evidence, we now have concrete results from formal schooling interventions since 1994.
The performance of the country since 1994 ought to reflect this increase in schooling, and it does, just not in the direction taxpayers and parents were promised.
A News 24 article points out that in 1994 the enrolment rate for children between 7 and 15 was 89.3 percent while this had swelled up to 97.6 percent in 2021.
The 2018 Quarterly Labour Force Participation Rate report from Stats SA indicates that unemployment had risen from 20 percent in 1994 to nearly 30 percent before the COVID pandemic. By the first quarter of 2023 this had ballooned to 32,9 percent.
In 2023 South Africa had the third-highest crime rate at 76.86 crimes being committed for every 100,000 people. This is higher than in 1994 when the figure was 64.
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is 6,490 US dollars, below the average of 6,670 US dollars for emerging markets.
The schooling system has not only failed to equip its graduates with skills to at least be self-sufficient adults but has also created entitlement. Many formally schooled individuals often undervalue manual labour jobs, opting instead for administrative and managerial roles that are seen as more prestigious. This, of course, was not always the case, especially when schools taught practical trades as part of the curriculum. The level of interest from graduates to do a trade is so low that construction sites are often brimming with non-South Africans.
In 2017, while remodelling my home, I had to replaster the entire house because I couldn't find a skilled plasterer to recreate the original plaster pattern on the house. It is ironic that the house was constructed in 1978, most probably by a hardworking and highly skilled tradesman who did not have the same level of formal schooling as those born after 1994. Instead of wanting to do the trades, construction sites are disrupted by criminals who demand a share of the project, in cash, without working.
But the entitlement does not stop there. Since 2015, when a movement grew, demanding free higher education, the institutions of higher learning in the country have been annually vandalized by protesting 'students'. These are people who are supposed to be educated, and old enough to know the basics of being an adult, which is self-sufficiency at least. Being able to take care of oneself and any dependents, either by birth or through agreements, is the fundamental expectation of adulthood. This however seemed to have been missed in the 12 years of education because matric graduates still expect taxpayers to provide for them. 
The picture is not any better even for the administrative and managerial professions that have been the choice of graduates. Since as far back as I can remember, South Africa has had a plan to address ‘skills shortage’ for scarce skills. This list has been growing, which is strange considering the country has enough people and formal schools that are supposed to prepare people for these roles. I don't know of any government entity that functions properly, aside from the revenue collecting service. As long as the tax money is coming in, who cares if any service is delivered right? 
These entities are mostly staffed by graduates of the formal schooling system who should know what they are doing if the system achieved its stated objectives.
What is truly baffling is that while some of the candidates for these positions are capable of fulfilling their duties, their exceptional talent lies not in their work but in their inclination towards corruption. There is seldom a day when a new revelation about some graft by an official aimed at personal enrichment at the expense of the taxpayer is not revealed. Institutions meant to safeguard law and order, including the judiciary, are not lacking in having either inept or corrupt, often both people. The formal schooling system has failed miserably in improving the loyalty and morality of the citizenry. If most state employees are not stealing directly, they are doing so indirectly by not doing their jobs properly, whether intentionally or due to incompetence.
Since 1994, the nation has been under the rule of a political party that operates more like a criminal syndicate. In fact, since the African National Congress came to power the line between the two has blurred to the point of being indistinguishable. They have looted the country to regression such that any gains that were made before they took power are being lost with each day they remain at the helm.
The revelations of the Zondo Commission led the leader of the DA, to publish an article to that effect in March 2022 titled.

“The latest report of the State Capture Commission provides the most damning confirmation yet that the ANC is now little more than an organised crime syndicate masquerading as a political party.”
John Steenhuisen MP, Democratic Alliance (DA)
One of the reasons the voting majority of the country elected them was their promise of providing ‘free things’; free houses, free electricity, free schooling, free healthcare, etc. One can argue that they came to power because the masses that voted for them were not ‘educated’, hence they made the blunder. 
What has helped them remain in power, however, cannot be attributed to the same reason. With each passing election, the voters have become increasingly more schooled. The products of the formal school system are consistently voting a party into power, despite the party's proven assault on the country's citizens by stealing our tax resources. This has been demonstrated in multiple court cases and commissions of inquiry.
Graduates of the formal schooling system are incredibly disconnected from reality, such that they support policies that have transformed once prosperous nations into begging states. South Africa is teeming with Zimbabweans who are seeking refuge from the dire circumstances in their country, due to the policies our populist politicians are pursuing. 
Nowhere in the world have socialist policies ever delivered the promised equality and prosperity. Nevertheless, it is astonishing that the highly educated youth, who have grown up in a free society, would resort to burning schools and destroying public and private infrastructure just to promote socialist policies.
Equality of outcome is one of the policies that have been advocated for by the ruling party, as if that has ever been achieved anywhere. Given that children from the same family, who grow up in the same environment with similar parents, circumstances, values, and opportunities, rarely achieve equal outcomes, how can a rational adult expect to accomplish this on a nationwide level? Yet, this has been one of the most popular policies that have kept the ruling party, and other populist parties, in power in the country.
Then there’s affirmative action, the policy that justifies discrimination on the bases of race & sex, consequently protecting a majority, against a minority! This policy believes that because some individuals of a particular race or sex have committed injustices against certain individuals of another race or sex, everyone belonging to the same race or sex as the wrongdoers is held responsible for their actions. If we continue this line of thinking, I would be held responsible for all the crimes and actions of the ruling party, simply because of my race. 
To believe that it is fair to punish an entire race or gender for the actions of a few individuals from that race or gender, who benefited a small group connected to the corrupt and guilty members of that race or gender, one must be ready to accept this reasoning when it affects them personally. We are after all Africans who believe in the spirit of Ubuntu, reciprocity, universally interpreted as the golden rule. If you believe in penalizing every white person for the actions of a few white politicians and their associates who have benefited from those actions, then it is only fair for you, as a black person, to also accept responsibility for all the corruption within the ANC, given that the ANC supposedly represents the black majority. 
Whether you benefited is immaterial, as is the case for government-sanctioned affirmative action policies. We know it was a minority of white people who supported apartheid because the 1992 referendum to end apartheid was supported by 68,73 percent of the white population that voted.
The list goes on to include ‘decolonization’, newspeak by the politicians and their highly schooled followers. I never understood what the term meant until I experienced it. If one of the products of colonization was a thriving economy, then decolonizing it would mean regression and poverty, as is currently the case. Formal educational institutions have been actively promoting the idea of decolonized subjects, which in my opinion, they have indeed accomplished, given that graduates lack the basic skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic.  
If education does not fulfil its promise of improving citizens and their country, as proven by real experiences, then what does it actually achieve? Hindsight is 2020, so thankfully we can now evaluate the school system, not based on hoped for results or lofty ideals but actual results. 
Thus far, what has been achieved by the formal school system?

5.1. Plunder & Corruption
The Budget review of 2021 from the National Treasury reveals that the country's estimated allocation towards learning and culture was projected to grow from a staggering amount 387.2 billion Rands in 2020/21 - 416 billion Rands in 2024. This includes a monumental sum of 255.1 billion Rands for the Department of Basic Education DBE, making it the largest allocation of all to a single department. Only the debt servicing costs were more than the allocation to the DBE. According to a News 24 article in 2017, the country spends more of its budget on education than the US, UK, and Germany, as shown by United Nations data.
The ruling party, with its insatiable appetite for personal gain, has astutely capitalized on these taxpayer funds, ensuring that those loyal to the party are duly rewarded. In 1994, for example, there was only one cabinet minister with a deputy for the whole education portfolio. Suddenly in 2010, the portfolio was split justifying a doubling of the ministerial resources, consequently doubling of costs for the taxpayer. Naturally the beneficiaries of these new jobs are loyal cronies of the party. The party's intention to benefit its members using taxpayer money, while pretending to care for 'the poor', are most evident in the education department.
The express reasons given for the split, from the then president himself, were “necessary to speed up service delivery and efficiency.” The Department of Education annual report 2009/2010 stated the government had made education a ‘key priority’, thus justifying the creation of the two ministries with these focus areas “Basic Education will focus primarily on schools in order to achieve the goal of a quality basic education system. The Ministry of Higher Education and Training will deliver an improved higher education and training system which will provide a diverse range of learning opportunities for youth and adults.”
So, how much did service delivery improve since then? 
By the 2021/ 2022 financial year the basic education department had incurred 1.4 billion Rands in irregular expenditure. One of the points of pride from the then director general in the education department in 2009 was the department’s achievement of a clean audit. 
The same minister who was appointed for the Ministry of higher education is still in his role in 2023. How much have things improved in higher education? Has he maintained his job because of the good performance of his portfolio? 
Not even close, as some reports below will show.
The minister who benefited from the split, a Secretary General of the Communist Party
(SACP) couldn’t have been clearer about what communism was about. After he bought a flashy BMW for more than a million rand the public was vocal about his hypocrisy. Mail and Guardian ran an article where he apparently was defending himself that he was still a communist. People unfairly blamed him for being a hypocrite even though he was being honest, especially considering the behaviour of other communist leaders around the world. When resources are taken forcefully from their rightful owners through the imposition of taxes, the people close to the leaders always enjoy a luxurious lifestyle, while the majority suffers and struggles to make ends meet. That is the communist way, real life serves as reference, in this country and elsewhere.
Patronage is not confined to the top but spreads to the bottom, at each level benefiting those that are loyal to the party. The implementation of affirmative action and quotas were crucial in justifying the employment of incompetent and unqualified members that are loyal to the party. With merit not being the sole consideration, or even the most significant, one's qualification needed only to be loyal to the party. As long as the patron was of the right skin colour and sex, justification on these grounds was enough. 
Even when tertiary qualifications are a requirement for a position, some simply buy these from the tertiary institutions or lie about having them. This, of course, is facilitated by the same products of the formal schooling system which enable the fraud for personal gain. When a loyal member of a different skin colour or sex needs to be rewarded, it is often justified by claiming that the skills required are not available within the designated group.  
The opportunities to plunder billions are not only limited to internal appointments of party members but also the tenders. 
As long as bidders are willing to part with a hefty sum for the benefit of the party, they are guaranteed the jobs. Thankfully for an entrepreneur, in a system that doesn't use price, quality nor competence but skin colour and/ sex this came at no cost to them. 
Whatever the cost of the amount that is to be ‘donated’ to the party and its members, it is simply added to the cost of the project. Since quality, and even completion of the job in some instances are not prerequisites for qualifying for getting paid . Some jobs are not even completed, nor started, while everyone gets paid. Well, everyone except for the majority of labourers and suppliers if any work was done.
Corruption Watch published Sound the Alarm report which included 10 percent of the reports received between 2012 and 2021. The report looked into alleged corruption across the education/ formal schooling sector, primary and secondary schools, SETAs and technical, vocational, education and training (TVET) colleges. The report says corruption takes different forms and involves different parties depending on the institution. In schools, the most prevalent types of corruption are resource misappropriation, maladministration, and abuse of authority. 
The report also identifies principals and members of school governing bodies as the main culprits responsible for these unethical practices. Alarmingly, incidents of bribery and extortion are also prevalent, including allegations of sextortion, along with employment irregularities. This is only in primary and secondary schools; the list of allegations continues up the department’s ladder.
With a remarkable heritage tracing back to 1873, UNISA used to be widely acclaimed as a distinguished institution, a beacon of knowledge that transcended geographical boundaries. On their website, they exuberantly proclaim themselves as a "National gem with a worldwide impact.” However, it is unfortunate that the university is currently facing troubling corruption allegations. This is the sad state of affairs that corruption to benefit the party officials has led to in 2023.
This is one of the first universities in the world that enabled distant learners before the age of the internet to complete tertiary education. According to a Daily Investor article from January 2023, South Africa's universities have regrettably followed in the footsteps of UNISA, transforming into hubs for personal gain by exploiting budget allocations and procurement. This issue has led to a troubling wave of leadership turmoil in many of the country's top higher education institutions.
The consequences of this corruption have been life altering and sometimes life ending for others. Fort Hare, another institution with a rich history, has recently been a bloodbath, with a security personnel and fleet manager killed. They apparently were witnesses in a fraud and corruption trial against university staff.
The power that comes with having a prestigious job enabled by corruption has also had some life altering changes for some youths. Statistics South Africa reported that in 2021, between the ages of 10 to 19 years, there were 142 704 births. Not only is this number alarming, but it is truly more distressing to learn that some of these girls were impregnated by the very teachers and principals who exploited their positions of power and trust. And while a number of 142 704 births may be alarming, it is also important to note that it does not reflect the incidents where these teachers abused these children. Incidents of inappropriate conduct and statutory rape have also been perpetrated by some teachers who took advantage of their positions.
Rather than yield the promised outcomes, the budget allocations to the education department have enabled plunder and corruption that have regressed the country. After examining the available evidence and closely observing similar policies implemented elsewhere, and considering historical precedents, it becomes evident that these so-called "flaws" were not accidental weaknesses, but intentional features skilfully devised to serve specific purposes. 
Politicians wholeheartedly supported mandatory formal schooling, acknowledging its immense capacity to compel taxpayers, perplex parents and damage students, all the while directly bolstering the party and its devoted followers. The ruling party implemented tax funded education policies primarily for its own benefit, contrary to the Constitution, disregarding the burden imposed on taxpayers, parents, and children who are affected by them.
The intention from the beginning was never to benefit anyone in the country outside of the ruling party’s members, at the expense of the taxpayer.
Measured by that standard, I think the school system has achieved its objective.
5.2. Ensuring sustainable voting base
“Among English teachers, there are 97 Democrats for every three Republicans, with the proportion being even more one-sided among health teachers, with 99 Democrats for every one Republican. While there are slightly more Republicans among math and science teachers, among high school teachers overall, there are 87 Democrats for every 13 Republicans. It is important to understand the influence of schools of education, which train prospective teachers, on the political and ideological leanings of teachers.”
Lance Izumi

Left wing political parties, of which the country’s ruling party is one, have risen to power by promising ‘free-things’. The government secures votes by pledging to ensure that every citizen receives the vital necessities that they should be responsible for, such as income, housing, education, healthcare, and more. This is particularly beneficial in recently liberated nations, where individuals may not be familiar with effective libertarian policies that encourage personal responsibility, ultimately increasing freedom and minimizing government control.
The problem however is that the strategy is not sustainable as people will soon experience the non-delivery of the promised freebies. The previously uninformed voting public may also gain more knowledge and educate themselves on libertarian policies such that they see through the ruling party’s lies. After experiencing poor service delivery some people may opt to reduce their dependence on the government by improving themselves. Maintaining power is crucial for the ruling party, as it relies on securing the majority vote. Therefore, it is imperative for them to find effective strategies to ensure their continued dominance.
The schooling system provides the best strategy for achieving this objective. Contrary to popular belief, the poor quality of education provided by the schooling system is not simply a result of incompetence. The education system ought to provide students with practical life skills to improve their own lives and succeed financially. However, this may pose a threat to the voter base. The ruling party intentionally undermines the education system to prevent graduates from acquiring sufficient knowledge to unveil the ruling party's deception. The curriculum is also modified to indoctrinate the masses in propaganda that attributes blame for failure of the current government to someone else.
After completing their education, many young individuals find themselves well-informed about their entitlements but lacking the necessary skills for income generation. In response to this challenge, the government once again steps in to provide social assistance through grants. The disdain for the prosperous is cultivated in classrooms such that extorting them through high taxes is not only seen as acceptable but necessary to achieve ‘equality’. Racially divisive policies are hailed by the masses and accepted as truth because the indoctrination at school was so effective.
Those dependent on the government for their livelihoods cannot bite the hand that feeds them by not voting for the ruling party. Although these grants are often disguised as temporary measures, the recipients rarely manage to break free from their reliance. When people don’t work for their income, they never acquire the skills required to progress in a career path. The ruling party benefits greatly from the individual's loss, as they gain a lifelong supporter who will help them stay in power.    
It should be telling that even the most despotic governments that go out of their way to exploit their citizens often prioritise the formal schooling system and make it mandatory. The only way most of these governments have retained power other than brutal force was through indoctrinating its citizenry, from as young as possible with ideas meant to bolster the worship of the ruling party.
The hard left ideology that has accelerated the West’s demise and threatens the whole of humanity with World War Three was entrenched through the formal schooling system. In 2023 it is the most educated college liberal that is likely to not know the difference between men and women, believe that poverty is justification for criminality, and extorting money from those who earn it to distribute amongst those who don’t is a good thing, amongst other half-witted ideologies. This was achieved by constant repetition of man’s superior abilities over nature in formal schools and tertiary institutions.
It is often the case that the most radicalised people in society today are not only graduates of the formal schooling system but had the premium options available to them. One would think these are the people that ought to complain the least because they received ‘the best’ and suffered no direct impact due to the causes they advocate for. Sadly, private school graduates and alumni of ivy league colleges, in South Africa and elsewhere are often at the forefront of the exploitation of people. One of the most destructive movements in modern day that was embraced by even our politicians, Black Lives Matter was headed by someone who went to an affluent school at some point in her life.
Most college professors are liberal with only a small proportion identifying as conservative. It is no coincidence that liberals, who advocate for the government as a solution to people’s problems and promote victimhood would radicalise graduates and blind them to natural truths but not for, none of us would exist. 
The rise of people who feel justified to hate other people based on immutable characteristics and cumulative efforts of their ancestors the current generation had no role in, has only accelerated with the prominence gained by the formal education system.
There is a reciprocal relationship between politicians, government officials and intellectuals, whether in formal institutions or elsewhere. Politicians, especially on the left, depend on intellectuals to give credibility to the ideologies that justify government overreach and leftwing policies. In return the intellectuals, including college professors are rewarded with taxpayer funded research grants, and other lucrative opportunities for personal gain. 
Amongst the most effective ways to do this is to create dependency and present government as a solution to the populous at institutions of learning with professors and teachers at the frontline of this brainwashing.


5.3. Weakening the influence of parents
“It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong.”
― Thomas Sowell

I was raised by parents that value education, at the time though they couldn’t separate schooling from education. This meant we, as children, had to value schooling as a means of accessing the education we needed. I didn’t have any qualms about this because I loved learning and could see in my parents, my father especially the progress one made with a bit more education. Yes, there might have been times I dreaded going to school because of a task I hated, sport season comes to mind or some bully, but in general I didn’t need to be forced to go.
In 1682, slaves sought refuge in the mountains to escape the obligation of attending school. Similarly, when I was growing up, I witnessed numerous children resorting to extraordinary and inventive strategies in their quest for similar freedom. This seems odd because it had always been inculcated to me that school was to one’s benefit. There had always been plenty of highly schooled people that were doing materially better in the community, so there shouldn’t have been a temptation to drop out, and yet reality was proving me wrong. Even in the least materially developed village I stayed in, the teachers were amongst the most materially successful people, let alone the principal who was an even bigger inspiration.
During this period, I realized that there were laws that required students to attend a formal school. Not only did I later discover that this was an unconstitutional position, but the idea of having to coerce people into doing something that would actually benefit them left me perplexed.
As a child in primary school, if someone missed school the teacher would personally go to the child’s home to find out if anything was wrong since most of the teachers were from the community. There was no need for external intervention beyond the community, now imagine my shock when I discovered parents could legally be prosecuted for not sending their children to school. More than anything this struck me as sinister because if school is good, and parents and children benefit the most from it, why the need to compel them?
The act of breathing is immensely advantageous for my overall well-being, and there should never be a need for legislation to enforce such a crucial practice, just like with eating. I know this, animals know this as do all plants with no legislative enforcement. Indeed, there have been more cases of authorities limiting where individuals can breathe, rather than widespread fatalities resulting from people refusing to do so. Why would people need to be forced to do something that is supposedly good for them, unless there are malicious reasons behind it?
The 1994 ANC manifesto clearly stated the party will “introduce one education system that provides ten years of free and compulsory education for all children”. The party did not hide the fact that parents were, henceforth legally obliged to give up their children to access this education that is funded by them, as the taxpayers. Parents were stripped of their autonomy, as the government forcefully usurped their authority in making decisions for the welfare of their own children. 
Initially a substantial part of one's income is involuntarily given to the government. These funds give the government an incredible amount of power and lethal resources that are used to force taxpayers into handing over their own children.
Since the family structure already fulfilled the roles the government wanted to take on, the government had to weaken the family. Throughout history, parents have played a myriad of crucial roles in their children's lives. They have been consistent providers, ensuring that their children's needs are met. They have acted as protectors, always keeping their children's wellbeing at the forefront of their minds. Additionally, parents have served as educators, imparting valuable knowledge and skills to their children. These are just a few examples of the countless essential responsibilities that parents have shouldered. 
There is no greater threat to a power-hungry government than a well-functioning family structure. What better way was there to weaken this unit than separating the children from their parents for most of the day? 
In The 33 Strategies of War one of the strategies Robert Greene tackles is Defeat Them in Detail: The Divide-And-Conquer Strategy "Never be intimidated by your enemy's appearance. Instead, look at the parts that make up the whole. By separating the parts, sowing dissension and division, you can bring down even the most formidable foe. When you are facing troubles or enemies, turn a large problem into small, eminently defeatable parts." 
Most of us have been captivated by the beauty and often gruesome nature of big cats like lions catching their prey in the wild. These hunters are so skilled that they have evolved strategies to overcome prey that is sometimes significantly larger than themselves and outnumbers the hunters many times over. "They hunt water buffalo by stampeding them into the water where they can attack and kill the young or weak members of the herd. After the initial stampede, the lions herd the buffalo through the water and relentlessly pursue them for hours at a time " according to National Geographics.
Despite appearing extreme, given the current ruling party's track record, it is difficult to find many who would disagree that it is more focused on fighting its own citizens than on serving us. In South Africa, it is quite ironic that the term "public servant" is used. The situation is such that the public themselves serve the government employees and elected officials, who are considered to be the elite benefiting from our hard-earned tax money. Who else among us is more vulnerable and weaker than our children? Is it any wonder their predatory antics are targeting children? Making formal schooling seem authorized by the Constitution and passing related laws was a big move to reduce parental authority over their kids. But it was just the beginning.
Placing these children under the guidance of teachers authorized by the government creates the potential for them to be swayed towards embracing any ideology that aligns with the ruling party's interests.
Young people also miss out on acquiring practical skills that can make them self-sufficient. Consequently, they become reliant on the government for their sustenance in the future.
These laws say that children must be educated following a specific curriculum, whether parents disagree with it.  Similarly, the parent’s authority over their children to discipline and instill family values are subjugated under the guise of ‘children’s rights’. Parental authority is greatly diminished by the mere possibility of a child reporting abuse to the authorities, even in situations where there is no explicit law restricting a parent's right to discipline their child or transmit their family values.
Growing up in the rural Transkei, I personally witnessed the harassment and unjust stigma faced by parents who made the decision to prioritize their children's participation in agricultural work, animal care, or household responsibilities rather than formal education. No longer were parents seen as competent to raise and educate their children because the teachers and bureaucrats from the education department knew better. In earlier times, a child's involvement in the agricultural work of the home was not just typical, but also crucial for their growth and development.
The goal was to bestow invaluable skills and cultivate a profound sense of responsibility and accountability towards oneself and the family who depended on them to fulfil their responsibilities. Having a strong work ethic not only teaches the importance of hard work, but also instills an understanding of its connection to success. From an early age, we learnt that our efforts contributed greatly towards the rewards we received. For example, if we don't sow and nurture maize, we won't have a crop to harvest and may even go hungry.
Children were sent to formal schools in droves, sometimes from dawn until dusk to be taught at the hands of the ‘professionals’ by ‘specialists’. Children stopped learning useful skills at home and started learning abstract concepts as dictated by the government's curriculum. This took away from family time and resources, all to meet the politicians' desired outcome.
There has been no greater tool to facilitate this weakening of the parent’s authority than the school system. This has become so sinister that advocates of the education system have been pushing for children to attend school from younger ages. This is presented as a benefit to the parents as they can now have time to work, and the child is learning from a young age. 
The first 8 years of a child's life are crucial for their development. During this time, the experiences they have and the things they are exposed to play a significant role in shaping their identity and have a long-term impact on their brain. For those who seek to shape children for their own gain, it is crucial that they isolate them as early as possible from the parents.
Despite the political rhetoric to justify sending children to school early, research has shown that Early Childhood Education (ECE) can be detrimental to the child.  A study by Dr Sarah Alexander on Effects of Early Childhood Education revealed the following key findings.
 The most robust research points to parents/family having greater impact than the childcare/ECE experience on children’s developmental outcomes.
 Children attending full-time ECE/childcare as compared to part-time (around 12.5 hours per week or 2.5-hour sessions) do not have significantly better developmental outcomes.
 The evidence also points to ECE/childcare having both developmental risks and benefits. There can be cognitive gains (at least in the short-term and dependent upon the effectiveness of the primary school children go on to) but there can also be negative outcomes for children’s health, mothers’ sensitivity in interaction with their children, problem behaviours and aggression in children.
 The combined effects of home factors, ECE factors, and primary school factors are important to consider. The British EEPE 3 – 11 project notes that attending a less academically effective primary school can wash out any benefits to be gained from attending a more effective or a higher quality preschool. Children who did not attend preschool or attended a lower quality preschool can “catch up”. Results from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort in the US similarly point out that the longer-term effects of preschool experience can depend on classroom experiences during at least the first years of school (Magnuson, Ruhm & Waldfogel, 2007).
 Children attending childcare/ECE programmes can experience worse health outcomes than those who do not. They are more likely to need antibiotics for preventable illnesses.
An article in the Canadian Encyclopaedia titled Early Childhood Education May Harm Children also goes through research that reports negative impacts of early childhood education. The article not only highlights the negative impact on children but also on parents. “According to the Quebec study, parents are worse off since the child care program came into play. Mothers of daycare children are more depressed than their average counterparts. More of them report hostile or "aversive interactions" with their kids. And there is a significant deterioration in marital relationships.” the article cites. Furthermore, “Many families, in order to keep up their financial level, have to work really hard. That creates a lot of pressure. Throw kids in the mix, and there are a lot of arguments about who's not doing enough, and why”.
The Department of Basic Education wants to take on more responsibilities with Grade R, despite their poor performance. This seems irrational at first, but it makes sense when you look at their proposed budget. DBE would get an additional 20 billion to implement and staff the venture. Just like the education system and the government as a whole, it is clear that taxpayers will shoulder the burden, while parents and children will be the ones who suffer the most. Only politicians, government officials, and their associates will benefit, as they shamelessly drain the country's resources for their personal gain.
While it might be informative to look at research from countries, nothing replaces the experience we live through in the country. The country is failing in its entirety because of the ruling party’s policies that were geared to benefit the party at the expense of the people. South Africa no longer has reliable electricity, water and any service that is provided by the government. If the government cannot even provide basic services, how can I trust them with my child, who is the most valuable part of my life? Even if there are good willed people in the government, evidence has shown that the overall outcome of anything the government touches is failure.
"The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help. " 
Ronald Reagan.
One of the trendy words from leftist newspeak is ‘children of the community’. This somehow is supposed to imply that surrendering your children to the state school system, from as early as possible, fosters shared responsibility for raising children, communism. The community then, in this way is responsible for raising the child, as has been the case in most societies before. The same group effort that was played by hunter-gatherers is supposed to be replicated by the ‘children of the community’ model. However, this statement couldn't be falser. There is a striking contrast between a community living in a hunter-gatherer environment or remote rural areas, and the vibrant cities and towns characterized by effortless immigration and emigration.

5.4. A note on the meaning of community within the family context
In the past, parents, extended family, and the local community were responsible for educating children before the current formal education system. The concept of "community" is frequently misconstrued and employed as a way to coerce individuals into shouldering the costs linked to the public education system. Hence, it is crucial to establish a clear definition of what truly constitutes a community. I'll explain what a community is by using my village and my parents as examples.
I was born in Fort Malan, a rural village about 10 kilometres from the Eastern Cape shore. The homestead opposite where my maternal grandparents raised my mother is my uncle’s home. Next to his home is my aunt’s home, which is also separated by a street from another family relation.
These homes of immediate relatives tend to be located closer to each other with kinship ties loosening with proximity. On the other side of the village is another relative’s home, albeit by marriage to one of my uncles. Similarly, one of my grandfather’s siblings also married someone from within the same village, with others doing the same.
This is no different in my father's home in Nqabane, with immediate family located close to each other. Not far from their childhood home, two of my father's siblings built their homes. There are other families in the village I am related to, as was the case before. Despite never having stayed there I've never been lost each time I visited. Even when I was lost, I seldom needed to identify myself for the villagers to know which family I am from.
As a child, each time I visited either village I felt a strong connection with many of the people because of our family relationships. These ties instilled in me a profound sense of belonging. 
These even transcended the geographical limitations because even when we moved to where my family eventually built our home, most accepted us because they knew a Tshezi or Xaba, or were related to one or either of them.
Due to the historically low influx of outsiders and the prevalent custom of intermarriage within the community, virtually every parent within the village had a vested interest in the welfare of all children, as they were bound by kinship ties.
The community joined forces and made an investment in a shared goal, acknowledging their strong connection with the recipient of the resources, rather than simply offering charity. The community's composition remained relatively stable over an extended period, with few outsiders joining. This provided the "investors" with confidence that, even if not themselves, their future generations would reap the benefits.
The first schools I attended, until standard 7, were constructed mostly through the efforts of the community the school serviced. After the Bantu Education Act was implemented in 1953, education for people in the homelands was financed through direct taxes paid by residents of the homelands, instead of general state spending.
When there was a class short, the parents would pool their resources and build it. 
People who owned cows helped gather water from the river and other items that needed to be moved in large quantities. Other people would do the mud bricks, or whatever material was used and so on. I have attended school classes in church buildings twice in my life. Similarly, some of the church services have also been held in the classroom on Sundays.
When I was in standard 1, my first year in Lencane where I met SK, I used to attend church service in one of the classrooms at school, albeit not the one which we used for the standard one class. Two weeks before school closure for the year I sneaked into my class early in the morning before church service began. I knew where the teacher kept our grading papers so I opened the drawer to sneak a peek. That was one of the most difficult 2 weeks of my life, because I had to pretend I didn’t know I came first in my class to my parents. By the time the results were officially announced I was such a neurotic mess because I couldn’t believe that despite having dropped out of the previous class midyear I’d snatched the first place, especially at a new school.
Due to the remote location of the village, limited transportation options, and poor road conditions, communities needed to be self-sufficient for maintenance. This was due to the significant delays in response times from officials. This also extended to us as the school children as we also had to play our part. For most of my school life, if not all, Fridays were reserved for cleaning the school. While I don’t remember who assigned the duties, students used to complete the following:
Brought the cow dung from home to school for the floors.
Collected water from the river to clean classrooms.
Cleaned the school premises including classrooms, yard, toilets if there were any, etc.  
Also collected a large amount of paper outside the school premises that was littering the village.
Despite having limited financial resources, the community took pride in working together and accomplishing what they could. Consequently, I don't remember people from the community intentionally damaging school property. This is because they would also be harming something that they helped build, and would have to fix it again. Additionally, they were related to someone who would be affected by the damage. The community strongly disapproved of acts of vandalism or any other inappropriate behaviour within the school premises, and they consistently enforced strict consequences once the offender was recognized.
These communities were close-knit and committed to shared objectives. This was due to their long-standing familiarity with each other, spanning multiple generations, and because few people entered or left the villages.
Within that context, it is clear to see that the same definition cannot be used today for community. The demographic composition of rural villages has undergone a significant change due to the increase in population movement, driven by various internal and external factors. This change is especially noticeable among the younger population.
Why should someone help a stranger they don't know and will probably never meet? The same stranger who is just as likely to be friend or foe? Having moved between different villages in Transkei I experienced firsthand the difficulty it takes for new people in a village to be accepted. This eventually changed the population dynamics of the villages so much that we can no longer call those people communities in the traditional sense.
Part 2: Where I began

6. Homeschooling and the Law, The South African Constitution
1. Everyone has the right 
a. to a basic education, including adult basic education; and
b. to further education, which the state, through reasonable measures, must make progressively available and accessible.
2. Everyone has the right to receive education in the official language or languages of their choice in public educational institutions where that education is reasonably practicable. 
In order to ensure the effective access to, and implementation of, this right, the state must consider all reasonable educational alternatives, including single medium institutions, taking into account 
a. equity;
b. practicability; and
c. the need to redress the results of past racially discriminatory laws and practices.
3. Everyone has the right to establish and maintain, at their own expense, independent educational institutions that 
a. do not discriminate on the basis of race;
b. are registered with the state; and
c. maintain standards that are not inferior to standards at comparable public educational institutions.
4. Subsection (3) does not preclude state subsidies for independent educational institutions.
- Section 29, Bill of Rights, South African Constitution

The South African Constitution is the supreme law of the land with all other laws subordinate to it. In cases where any other law is inconsistent with the Constitution, it is the Constitution that always prevails. 
The status of homeschooling, as is that of any other form of education that qualifies as basic education, is protected. Our Constitution neither prescribes the formal schooling system nor defines what qualifies as basic education, leaving the choice to parents and legal guardians. 
The state must use reasonable measures to implement this right. If anyone can prove the state's measures are unreasonable, the Constitution will prevail.
The Constitution, in the preceding section clearly prioritises the parents and the family as the ones most suitable to provide the proper care required by the child. The only time the child can be cared for by someone other than the family is if there are justifiable grounds to prove the preferred option places the child in danger.
Similarly, as the parent who has an obligation to care for my child, I am well within my rights to object to formal schooling if it interferes with my obligation to my child. I am not aware of how one can justify taking a child away from parents and family to be taught and ‘cared’ for by strangers as reasonable, other than in cases where the parents and family have been declared a danger to the child.

6.1. Am I breaking the law by not sending my child to a formal school?
“8.1 The Schneider case
In the Schneider case, the court clarified that:
a parent who wants to home educate her or his child has to comply with the relevant legislation, particularly ss3 (1) and 51 of the Act; and
the court shall not sanction a breach of the Act with regards to compliance with it by a parent who requires to home educate her or his child”
-	Policy on Home Education. Government Gazette No. 42037 – 16 November 2018
Simple answer, NO.
The right to homeschool is protected by the Constitution. The Schneider Case went further to clarify that while a parent has to follow certain legislation, noncompliance to this legislation will not be sanctioned as a breach of the relevant legislation. 
The fact that one cannot be criminalised for a breach of a statute further serves as an acknowledgment of the dubious position of the Department of Basic Education’s position in regulating homeschooling. Section 3(1) of the South African Schools Act, 1996 for example prescribes mandatory formal school attendance from 7 years until 15 years of age. The prescribed sanction for in the same section subsection 6(a) & (b) is a fine or 6 months imprisonment. Section 51 on the other hand demands parents register children who are being homeschooled.
In a quest to interfere with the rights of parents and justify more tax being extorted, the ruling party and likeminded allies are pushing forward with the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill that is hellbent on striping the parents and push children to a formal education system that has failed to achieve any of its objectives at a great cost to parents and children, all for the benefit of the African National Congress and linked cronies.
None of this has gone unnoticed and many are against this bill. Amongst others at the forefront of the opposition is AfriForum and The Institute of Race Relations (IRR). The bill has received criticism for not addressing the many problems affecting the Department of Education in the country.
“The bill will centralise more power in the incompetent hands of the State and render communities’ involvement in their schools by way of democratically elected governing bodies meaningless. Currently, the governing bodies have the right to make the final decision on schools’ language and admissions policies, but the bill proposes that this power should henceforth rest with the provincial heads of education, in other words with political appointments. It is being argued that this amendment is necessary to prevent discrimination against learners, but this is a blatant fabrication, as existing legislation provides for the necessary steps to put an end to discrimination, should it occur.”
Alana Bailey, AfriForum’s head of Cultural Affairs
Thankfully many parents like myself will have none of it. It is also worth noting that there have been entities that have been supporting the freedom of homeschoolers with the Pestalozzi Trust being amongst the most notable in the country. The opposition parties like Freedom Front Plus (FF+), The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), have voiced strong opposition to the Bill and have been undertaking steps in that regard.
The Pestalozzi Trust, has a principal goal to: “to preserve the fundamental universally and constitutionally recognised rights of parents and families diligently to guide and direct the education of their children”. The Trust, which has committed significant resources to preserving the right to homeschool over the years has also continued in this regard to fight the bill. In an article titled Authorities wanted home education scrapped: Drama at BELA Bill from Marketing Spread Bouwe van der Eems, who is the Pestalozzi Trust Chairperson has published some quotes confirming the government’s relentless fight against homeschooling in the country.
“The implication of scrapping the home education (sic) should be explored; religious fundamentalism could also be a factor in this regard.” and that “Discouraging home education should be created by making parents pay for the expenses in this regards (sic).”
Unnamed role player, The minutes of a Council of Education Ministers meeting on 9 March 2017 
“The senior management also recommended that in the quest of developing this policy, they should create some significant stringent measures that will make it not easy for parents to opt for home education.”
The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of the Policy on Home Education, senior officials
“Education officials in KZN are already attempting to make home education impossible by declining registration applications without valid reasons. Parents submitted appeals, but after numerous reminders, the KZN MEC failed to attend to the appeals. The Pestalozzi Trust is now going to court to force the MEC to decide on the appeals.”

6.2. Homeschooling and the South African Constitution
Every child has the right ­
to a name and a nationality from birth;
to family care or parental care, or to appropriate alternative care when removed from the family environment;
to basic nutrition, shelter, basic health care services and social services;
to be protected from maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation;
to be protected from exploitative labour practices;
not to be required or permitted to perform work or provide services that ­
are inappropriate for a person of that child's age; or
place at risk the child's well-being, education, physical or mental health or spiritual, moral or social development;
not to be detained except as a measure of last resort, in which case, in addition to the rights a child enjoys under sections 12 and 35, the child may be detained only for the shortest appropriate period of time, and has the right to be ­
kept separately from detained persons over the age of 18 years; and
treated in a manner, and kept in conditions, that take account of the child's age;
to have a legal practitioner assigned to the child by the state, and at state expense, in civil proceedings affecting the child, if substantial injustice would otherwise result; and
not to be used directly in armed conflict, and to be protected in times of armed conflict.
A child's best interests are of paramount importance in every matter concerning the child.
In this section "child" means a person under the age of 18 years.
Section 28 Children, SA Constitution

Although it may seem like a practical approach to begin exploring homeschooling with Section 29, it is actually Section 28 that holds the utmost importance. Section 28 establishes the tone and serves as a guiding principle, prioritizing the well-being and best interests of the child in all matters concerning them.
In November 1989 the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Children (UNCRC) was adopted and opened for signature and ratification. It came into force in September 1990. South Africa signed the Convention in 1993 and ratified it in 1996. According to the South African Parliament the Convention was the first international treaty the ANC led government ratified. Article 3 of the convention deals with the best interest of the child. 
1.  “In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.
2.   States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures.
3.   States Parties shall ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities, particularly in the areas of safety, health, in the number and suitability of their staff, as well as competent supervision.”
-      Convention on the Rights of the Child
The Convention recognizes that the family is important. The family is considered the fundamental social group and the natural environment for individuals, especially children, to grow and thrive. The Convention thinks that the family should receive the support it needs to fulfil its responsibilities within the community.
Given the problems faced by the DBE, it's unclear how anyone can argue that it's best for a child to attend a traditional school, especially when there are superior options available. DBE's performance is directly linked to the high unemployment rate among the youth and other societal problems in the country. Almost all indicators show that the department fails in even its basic mandate of teaching basic literacy and numeracy. The government, through the DBE has failed to act in the best interest of the child as required by the UNCRC. 
“Central to this is the recognition that every child has basic fundamental rights. These include the right to:
Life, survival and development;
Protection from violence, abuse or neglect;
An education that enables children to fulfil their potential;
Be raised by, or have a relationship with, both parents even if they are separated;
Express their opinions and be listened to.
Have their privacy protected, and
Their lives are not subject to excessive interference”
SA Parliament – Fast Facts: United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)

6.3. What is Basic Education?
“My responsibility in ensuring the right to education
The right to education places on me the responsibility to:
attend school regularly, to learn, and to work hard,
cooperate respectfully with teachers and fellow learners and
adhere to the rules and the Code of Conduct of the school.
and concurrently places on my parents and caregivers the responsibility to:
ensure that I attend school and receive their support
and places on my teachers the responsibility to:
promote and reflect the culture of learning and teaching in giving effect to this right.”
- A Bill of Responsibilities for the youth of South Africa

Over the years various stakeholders who benefit from the schooling system have bamboozled parents into thinking that compulsory formal schooling is the only option available to them for educating their children. No one has been more complicit in this than the Department of Basic Education (DBE) itself.
Efforts to deter anything beyond the formal education system are made with great determination, whether through the portrayal of dissent as an illegal act or the implementation of alternative methods. Heideli Loubser quotes one such example in an illuminating article on SA Homeschoolers. 
“In a recent interview on SAFM (9 December 2019), spokesperson for the DBE Elijah Mhlanga implied that home education is only suited for families with children who have severe illnesses or special needs, or for wealthy families who can afford to spend the time. Educational psychologist Thea Groenewald added that home education is more difficult than people think and echoed Elijah’s sentiment that parents are often not sufficiently equipped to teach complex subjects, particularly in the high school phase.”
Home education is for everyone, not only the sick or wealthy – here’s why - Heideli Loubser, SA Homeschoolers
In 2011, Minister for Basic Education Angie Motshekga launched the Bill of Responsibilities campaign. The campaign was directed at the youth with an intention of teaching them the responsibilities that come with having rights. While this interpretation is suspect in many ways, including the convenient omission of the state’s responsibility while other role players have been clearly identified, a school is interpreted as a formal school. 
This started back when The South African Schools Act 84 of 1996 confined the definition of school to formal schools, contrary to the Constitution. What the ruling party could not achieve under the Constitution was made as though it had been achieved, through subordinate legislation, and most of us were convinced the legislation derived its authority from the Constitution.
The Constitution neither prescribes formal schooling nor defines basic education. According to The Constitution and the Right to a Basic Education by Chris McConnachie, Ann Skelton, Cameron McConnachie an adequacy-based approach is preferred when defining basic education. Parents are crucial role players in defining what is basic education and as the one that will bear the costs for this later on, they are the most competent. 
“It is important to remember that the courts are just one of the many institutions that have a role in defining the content of a basic education. 
Lawmakers and policymakers play a crucial role in expanding on the content of this right through detailed laws and policies. 
Teachers, learners, parents, activists and community organisations also have an important role to play. 
Through lobbying and activism, ordinary people can create changes in the way the right to a basic education is understood and applied. 
Defining the right to a basic education is ultimately a democratic and cooperative exercise.”

6.4. Other Countries and the International Perspective
“The Constitution of Nicaragua (1986) proclaims in Article 121 that all shall receive free and compulsory education.
The Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (1977) (in Article 45) declared that all citizens of the USSR have the right to education, which shall be free at all levels and compulsory at the primary and secondary levels, including higher education.
Article 20 the Constitution of Cyprus (1960) provides that every person has the right to receive education or instruction, with primary education being free and compulsory.
The Egyptian Constitution of 1971 provides for full and compulsory education (De la Vega 1994:48-49; Hodgson, 1998:11-12; Nowak 1995:191; Wringe 1981:139).”

Recently one of the many criticisms that was labelled by American conservative news publications was the American government’s intention to deport a German Christian Family. According to The Daily Wire, the family has been living in the United States since leaving Germany in 2008. The German government's choice to penalise the family for opting to homeschool their children prompted their move.
The Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany prescribes compulsory schooling under state supervision. In countries where the intention is to prescribe compulsory education this is enshrined in their most supreme law. There are many other countries where homeschooling is legal. SA Homeschoolers has covered the topic extensively.
The South African Constitution embraces the parent’s critical role as the primary role player in their child's education. In this spirit it has preserved this right by not prescribing compulsory schooling as the only means of delivering basic education. This is also evident in other sections of the Constitution that preserve and promote the critical role of the parent and family.


7. Departure Point
“There is nothing so bad, no good can come of it”

The prospect of change can be quite daunting, especially when considering that the majority of us and our parents have experienced traditional schooling. I am well aware of this, as it was an absolutely terrifying experience for me. Although I began pursuing the idea at a young age, I was uncertain about the approach I should take. While I was fully convinced that the traditional education system was not suitable for my children, I found myself unsure about the best approach to provide them with an education.
For all the atrocities due to government overreach, the COVID pandemic was not devoid of benefits. It was when my nephew’s school had to go on a lockdown that catalysed the transition to homeschooling. This gave me a soft landing and eased the transition. The nationwide lockdowns proved to be an advantage as they provided us with the opportunity to experiment with homeschooling, without the concern of Solo lagging behind his peers in the classroom.
While the pandemic helped me to pull the trigger, a lot of other factors went into the decision.
My departure point in assessing whether homeschooling would be suitable for my children was myself. Considering I went through the traditional schooling system, it was easy to reflect on my experiences. 
When I was younger, I took it for granted that I managed to make a success of myself because I went through the formal schooling system and worked hard on my studies.
When I compared the outcomes of people who attended similar schools and had the same education level as me in adulthood, I realized something. Given that qualifications are obtained from similar schools and tertiary institutions, it would be reasonable to expect that the progress of graduates should be comparable if the school truly has such a significant influence on individuals.
Throughout my life, I firmly held this belief, as it was ingrained by my school teachers. However, my personal experience, along with the experiences of others, have revealed a truth that contradicts this belief. Similar outcomes are seldom the norm but the exception.
What's even more disheartening is that most people who have achieved extraordinary material success often lack formal education in the very field they excel in. Many of them either dropped out or rejected the education system when they were exposed to it. While names like Albert Einstein, Elon Musk, Andrew Carnegie, to mention a few may come to mind as examples we needn’t look that far.
Most of the people who have large herds of livestock in rural South Africa seldom went to a formal school, and if they did, they didn’t go that far. They somehow made a success of themselves in spite of not having gone to school. One of the biggest livestock owners in their community is our ex-president who coincidentally never even finished matric yet went on to rule the nation. This is the case for a huge number of politicians and bureaucrats who occupy the highest levels of government in the country.  
The fundamental essence of success, and a vital foundation for all other forms of success, lies in the capability to continue one's lineage through the birth of offspring and provide for it long enough until it can do the same. Even when one doesn’t bear children themselves there’s an obligation to safeguard their genes that might be in their siblings, cousins or nephews and nieces. 
The argument for a formal education system fails completely in this area, considering that formal schooling as a norm has only existed for a mere century or two, whereas humanity has thrived for millennia. Anyone who is alive today is proof that their ancestors lived long enough to successfully breed and raise them.  
My grandparents from both sides barely had any formal schooling, they lived long enough to have their own children. Those children who also had minimal education went on to do the same. This is the case for most South Africans, and likely on a larger scale beyond even this continent. As mentioned earlier, the current generation of parents is facing the challenge of providing for their highly educated adult children, who are unable to support themselves and their own families.
When all this eventually dawned on me, I realized how I had, like many grossly overrated, the benefits of having gone to school. The things I took for granted about my parents suddenly took centre stage as I realized the monumental contribution they played in my success. It was these qualities I came to revere even more about my parents, the ones I wanted to amplify when I opted to homeschool.
By the time I went to school for the first time I already knew how to count, the alphabet, spell my name, read basic words, amongst other things. My mother would use any spare time to teach me at home, as did my father when he was back from work. 
Similarly, they always did their best to avail learning resources at home. There were significantly more books at home, relative to most rural homes that surrounded us at the time. As mentioned before, burning a book was sacrilege in my house. I remember when they bought our first television, I must have been around 8 years old. Within 3 years I could fix the same television when it broke based on my curiosity. While tinkering with gadgets and electronics as a child did not always go well, the lessons I gained from the experiences were mostly self-taught.
7.1. School background of the parents versus post school progress
“Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I’ll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select—doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors.”
John Broadus Watson

One of the things that used to fascinate me as a child was when an elder who was a stranger would approach me and ask if I was my father or mother’s son. These are people who knew my parents very well but didn’t know I was their child, yet, based on certain features and looks they’d often correctly deduce whose child I am. Sometimes it wouldn’t even be the looks that link me to my parents but mannerism. By knowing my parents, or even other members of my extended family, some people would correctly identify my family through me.
Later on, I’d learn about the heritability of personality traits, something that flew against the teachings at school. The prevailing opinion, especially as support for formal schooling, emphasized the role of nurture more than nature. Genes were presented as having little to no impact on who people become. The environment in which we are raised determines who we are, and it is the main factor that shapes our identity, so went the theory. John Broadus Watson supported the prevailing opinion.
Thankfully, both reality and his contemporaries would later show that Watson grossly overestimated the role of nurture while undermining that of nature. I particularly enjoyed Why
You Are Who You Are: Investigations into Human Personality by Mark Leary, Ph.D. from The Great Courses. In the course, amongst other things, the professor does a great job in illuminating the inheritability of different personality traits. Another author that blew my mind on the subject is Steven Pinker’s The Blank Slate, The Modern Denial of Human Nature. Pinker went above and beyond to dispel some of the misconceptions that fueled denial of nature's role.
Sazi is fortunate to be born to parents who are comparable enough to see the impact of both nature and nurture. Even better is that no longer can allegations about women’s progress in life be attributed to society and ‘the patriarchy’ holding them back. Since 1994 there has been a concerted focus on directing taxpayer-funded programs to the upliftment of women; from educational programs at school, admission and funding of tertiary programs for women to employment and business funding that explicitly exclude boys and men.
This ought to mean comparable men and women ought to achieve the same outcomes since there are essentially no differences between men and women. Lawmakers have implemented programs to empower and uplift girls and women. These initiatives have actively sought to address the claimed long-standing societal and patriarchal barriers that have hindered their progress. So based on this, the difference in the sex of parents no longer favours men thus making comparing outcomes possible.
We were both born the same year, her in July and me in September, in what is now the Eastern Cape. We both went to public school, albeit differently classified. I went to non-fee paying, mostly rural schools until high school where I moved to a similarly ranked high school in Embalenhle township.
She went to a quintile-5 school in urban Port Elizabeth with the last 10 years spent on 2 suburban schools of the same name (primary and High School) within 6 kilometres of her home.
Although I don't possess the data regarding the schools' performance in 1999 when I finished, the data from 2022 was available. According to Seskhona News, “..Kiriyatswane Secondary School took last position within the Circuit with a 39.6 percent pass rate which deteriorated from last year’s percentage..” My son’s mother’s alma mater on the other hand achieved a 100 percent pass rate in 2022 with 94.6 percent eligible for degree courses while 5.4 percent for diploma courses.
If the school, and the quality of it thereof, plays such a pivotal role on one’s success in life then based on the above there should be no question about who has the best outcomes. Irrespective of the metric used to evaluate absolute success between us, be it with income levels, tax contribution, asset ownership, quality of life etc, the outcomes should be decisive. Based on the gap between the schools in terms of resources and performance, there should be just as big of a gap between the two of us.
I can report that such a gap exists, and it is as big as one may expect. 
What is unexpected is that the gap does not favour better-resourced schools having an absolute advantage, or any advantage at all for that matter. If we view schooling as an investment, which it is, considering the financial and other resources parents and children invest in it, it stands to reason that the more we invest, the greater the returns should be. Someone from underprivileged schools shouldn't be able to achieve the same level of success, at least material, as someone from more privileged schools.    
Performing this exercise was such an eye-opener on not only the futility of schools as having an absolute advantage in influencing one’s outcomes but the detriments of sacrificing so much for such underwhelming results. Sazi's most relevant experience has revealed that nothing could be more foolish than replacing my role in his education with money and external surrogates.
I wanted to use this exercise to determine whether it is beneficial, in the quest for better education to spend more money and resources on formal schooling; the conclusions showed the opposite.
The reality is so extreme that if attending ‘better schools’ was decisive, my son would not exist. If one considers hypergamy, the gap between us would have meant we most likely couldn’t have met. We would have been so incompatible that even the chance of meeting and staying with each other long enough to breed would have been next to impossible.
This is even more relevant considering our child is a boy. In raising my son and figuring out educational options for him I often reflect on my experiences. As a man, my relative success was always based on my father and my parents as a unit, never my mother alone. Until the day I could better my father’s best I could never even speak of being successful. This is what my father taught me, as he was taught by my grandfather. There is no greater compliment my son can pay me than to better my best, as I have to my father and him to my grandfather. Anything less is akin to failure!
7.2. Personality of the child and parents.
One of the things that people enjoy about school is the sports and recreational activities that offer them opportunities to play with others. For me, this was one of the things I liked the least about school. It could be that I never had much of an interest in sports, and it didn't help that I had nosebleeds that would turn the grounds crimson with the least activity. My nosebleeds didn't even require physical stimuli; as soon as my body temperature and heart rate reached a certain point, the taps would open.
After school, I also had very little interest in being with other children beyond a certain point. My mother's strict routine probably also contributed to this. It may appear that I am biased towards the influence of nurture on my behaviour by this admission, that is not actually true. While my mother certainly had an important influence on my upbringing and the environment I grew up in, her actions were simply a reflection of her true nature. This nature, which I also inherited at a genetic level, had a varying degree of influence on me.
While other children had freedom to go and play until late and could stay out as much as they wanted, our situation at home was different. The routine was strict:
Wake up in the morning and go straight to school.
Go straight home with no detours after classes.
Complete your household duties and ensure the uniform is ready for tomorrow with shoes polished.
Then go play outside the yard with other children.
Come back before 6 pm, lest you find the gate locked.
Complete your homework before bed.
We also did not have livestock at home unlike some people in the village. This meant opportunities to socialize while looking after the cows in the grazing fields were minimal to none existent. As a teenager, we harvested water at home, which reduced the need to go to the river. However, it also decreased the chance to socialize with other children. In high school, I was used to my parents' routine, so I chose to stay around the house instead of going out, even though I had more opportunities to do so.
Even in my adult life, very few things annoyed me as much as people who associated having a 'life' with going out. To date, there is no place I'd rather be than at home, which I have also evolved to be my workplace. Despite the hardships caused by the 'Covid pandemic,' including unjust government-imposed lockdowns and intrusive measures, it has also brought about unforeseen advantages. One is the remarkable surge in remote working and remote learning.
Not only with me but I also saw a lot of people’s perceptions about the home as a primary place for working and schooling. This bolstered my decision to forge ahead and take a different path with my kids’ education.

7.3. The family environment. 

“In 1953, prior to the apartheid government’s Bantu Education Act, 90 percent of black South African schools were state-aided mission schools. 
The Act demanded that all such schools register with the state, and removed control of African education from the churches and provincial authorities. 
This control was centralized in the Bantu Education Department, a body dedicated to keeping it separate and inferior. 
Almost all the mission schools closed down. 
The Roman Catholic Church was largely alone in its attempt to keep its schools going without state aid. 
The 1953 Act also separated the financing of education for Africans from general state spending and linked it to direct tax paid by Africans themselves, with the result that far less was spent on black children than on white children.”
South African History Online (SAHO) - Bantu education and the racist compartmentalizing of education
Before the ubiquity of the traditional schooling system, it was the families that fulfilled this role. The nuclear family and single parents that stay in smaller households was the exception rather than the norm. Family members tended to stay together in one area. This meant in one homestead there were grandparents, parents, uncles and aunts and so on.
This in turn created a strong supportive environment which, among other things, fulfilled the following roles the formal schooling system has been attempting to replace:
Look after the children who were too young to participate while the adults and older children were working the fields and tending to livestock, amongst other work.
Learning from the different family members practical skills that contributed towards the sustainability and success of the family.
In a homestead school, the child is related to most people there through blood or marriage, so most people are invested in the child's success. This is different from public or private schools where the child is just a means for politicians, bureaucrats, and teachers, to mention a few, to get paid.
The statement may seem harsh to some in education, but it's undeniable that a salary is a crucial motivator. Many people would not want to educate and care for other people's children if there were no incentive, just like in 1953 when the government stopped funding religious schools. Most people who choose to stay would likely be driven by self-interest, such as the personal benefits of being seen as empathetic. These benefits can then be leveraged for political influence or financial gain. 
While it is possible to homeschool as a single parent or a couple that has work commitments during the day, it is harder to implement. If someone finds themselves in that circumstance, they could hire an individual to take care of their child and provide homeschooling. The expenses of employing a qualified person for this task can rapidly add up. 
Additionally, the quality of care and attention the individual provides will likely depend on the amount they are being paid. If one of the advantages of homeschooling is to entrench family values it could be counterproductive to employ a stranger to do this, no matter their credentials or experience for that matter. 
Where the parents work from home, however, this becomes much more feasible. Having a parent around, even if they have a nanny due to a busy work schedule, ensures a sense of security and reliability.
My kids are somewhat fortunate in that they have their grandmother, aunts and myself in the home. This helps to spread the work, not only in terms of volume but also skill set as well. There are things that my mother does better than I could, similarly with my sisters and partner. The inverse is just as true, but even if there are things that only I can do better than all of them combined I could never have enough hours in a day. I never have the pressure to cook, clean, check on the kids' health because my family is there and much more competent at those roles than me.
In my son's life there is only one person who has a proven track record of not only raising boys but a man, successfully, despite the limited material resources she had. There is no one’s expertise I consider more informed than hers for the overall wellbeing of my boys. This is important since 4 out of her 5 grandchildren are boys. 
Similarly, in the case of Mila, my mother’s track record speaks for itself for raising women who now all have an interest in her.
When my father died, despite the impact of the loss, this also allowed me to think about the environment I would like my son to be in if ever the same happened to me. Despite not having built our family home in the villages they were born in; our family home was within 30 kilometres of either family. This meant that whenever there was something that required a man in the house, there were more than enough male relatives from either side to come and help.
Similarly, with my cousins, they were never too far, especially as roads got better and transport became more accessible. For most of my childhood there was always one or another cousin who would come and stay with us. In primary school, for example, I never missed being born the only male at home because one of my cousins stayed with us. After my father died, his father, my uncle became the father figure in my life.
These experiences showed me the value of the family, immediate and extended. Despite the misunderstandings that often prevail when it mattered the most, it was always family who could be relied on.
It also didn’t help that I dreaded the times I parted with my cousins as they went home. Because we’d had so much fun there was a gaping hole they left when we parted, I wanted to reduce this as much as possible for my son.
As a firstborn I also had a duty to succeed my father and look after my mother and siblings. Although school taught me that this was an outdated practice and that I would have been better off focusing on inheriting my father's assets for my own benefit, it was the strong emphasis on family values that ultimately prevailed. This was not because they had sounded good on paper or had been presented by a world-famous researcher, but because I saw they worked through my experience.
In fulfilling my duty to my father, I managed to keep my family coherent in an environment that is conducive for homeschooling. While I could have left my mother and sisters to fend for themselves in the Eastern Cape, it seemed more logical to take them with me, and work towards a house to accommodate everyone. The vulnerability of the female headed household, especially in rural South Africa is a well-documented phenomenon, leaving them could have sealed their fate.
Because I opted otherwise, I have retained the wisdom my mother can pass to her grandchildren and created an environment where my son seldom goes a week without seeing his cousins.
This has created a home that is most conducive for my children learning at home.     

7.4. Better when there’s more than one child
In my experience I have observed there’s no substitute for children interacting with each other and learning from their age group. In a traditional school, children have the opportunity to interact with each other, learn from each other, compete, and socialize. I might have a problem if I attempted to home school my son, who is my only child, alone.
Thankfully his cousins, most of whom are in the same age group surround him. The children easily keep each other company without ever being bored and restless in the home. They help each other learn difficult concepts. For instance, when they were learning the alphabet, they would sing together and correct each other's mistakes. Milande's computer skills are improving so rapidly that he is now assisting others when they have small computer issues.
Having a teenager also helps a lot in the process. It's amazing how he now instils some of the lessons we taught him to his cousins and sister. No child, however, is enjoying the presence of his cousins more than my youngest nephew. As the last to be born he gets to enjoy having older children around him to play with and guide him.
The multi-generational and multi-parent setup also helps with discipline. No matter how hard I try to be firm sometimes with my son, there's times I just melt in his presence. It’s even worse when he wants to do something he knows he shouldn’t, he somehow has a charm he can turn on to weaken my defences and let him get away with a 'misdemeanour'. Thankfully I don’t have to worry because when grandma says NO, it doesn’t matter that daddy capitulated.
Similarly, when I have taken a stand, and he is not happy with me, there is always someone to pick his spirits up in any of his aunts, cousins and grandmother.

Part 3: How we make it work.

8. Hardware and Software Requirements
The formal schooling system has a major advantage. It takes care of all the logistical issues, relieving parents from worrying about them. Parents can easily avoid any involvement in their child's education, especially if the school is in the lower quantile range. Schools have a duty to accept all children, even in activities that parents must participate in. They cannot expel a child as a last resort to force their participation, as this would be illegal. 
Parents with children in the formal schooling system usually only need to focus on ensuring that their child attends school. They can choose to have little to no involvement in the complexities of how school operates. The situation has deteriorated as the government has assumed control over formal education. In the past, schools in communities were the product of collaborative efforts by community members themselves.
There’s no such thing as homeschooling. One has to be involved in everything! 
Although homeschooling may initially appear demanding, it offers numerous opportunities to save expenses due to its alignment with typical household and family activities. The desk that is suitable for doing homework at the end of a traditional school day is equally suitable for homeschooling, if it is even necessary. 
In the end, the flawless combination of homeschooling and the household environment proves advantageous for both parents and children. Outsourcing tasks to a surrogate can be helpful if not necessary at times, but most things become the family's responsibility. This can lead to the family learning lessons and gaining new skills.




8.1. Home Classroom Requirements
I have always found having a dedicated study desk beneficial, from when I was studying offline to until my current setting that is a hybrid. The biggest condition is that it must have some peace and quiet, although I can always isolate myself with earplugs if need be. I struggle with getting much done when my bed is in sight. My body interprets even the temptation of working from the couch as an invitation to nap.
My minimum requirements a quite simple;
A chair and desk. To be more productive, you need a chair that supports good posture and is reasonably comfortable for sitting without interruption for around an hour. I encourage my kids to take frequent breaks to promote physical activity while also avoiding boredom.
Adequate storage. Books and papers quickly accumulate and if not careful you will find them taking over your home. It makes sense to have a dedicated storage area for all the learning resources, especially in cases where you don’t have a dedicated room. This will not only facilitate easy access and retrieval but also increase the lifespan of the items. 
Good lighting and sufficient ventilation are a given.

Although having a computer is convenient, it is not necessary. Later on, you will realize that there is an option to purchase all the learning material in physical copies. In addition, when necessary, online resources can be conveniently accessed through cell phones, internet cafes, libraries and other means.

8.2. Hardware Requirements
I opted to equip each of the children with a computer so that they could learn online and offline. As a minimum;
A computer for each child connected to the internet.
Modems and routers enable the internet connection and Wi-Fi signal.
A printer, even monochrome, to ensure there are hard copy workbooks.
Although purchasing physical curriculum and learning materials can help reduce computer use, it is still crucial to have access to the latest online resources. I am a fan of an option that is at least hybridized between the full offline paper option and the full online. We are after all preparing the children for the future and computer skills are essential to that. The first time I touched a computer in my case I was 17, in my first year in tertiary!
8.2.1. Computers
These days one is spoiled for choice when purchasing computers, from our smartphones to tablets, laptops/ Chromebooks and the traditional desktop. Each device has its own hardware and form factor, which also implies a variety of software differences. Consequently, some devices are better suited than others for online learning purposes.
8.2.2. Smartphones and Tablets
While it is possible to be productive on a smartphone or tablet, these devices were mostly designed for media consumption and entertainment. Even their layout and form factor which is typically smaller than a desktop or Laptop, often with no physical keyboard supports their consumption orientation.
This is why I personally would not recommend using them, especially for the option that requires daily engagement with a computer. Using a mobile phone to access online reference resources is acceptable, although tablets are preferable due to their larger size. However, it is important to avoid excessive usage of these devices for extended periods of time. Concentrating on the small screen as the sole resource over a long time is straining to the eyes, not to mention the pain of typing on the small keyboards.
8.2.3. Laptops, Chromebooks and MacBooks
These are great, sometimes even better than a desktop computer if one has limited space. They are also convenient to travel with, ensuring the student can learn wherever they are, even when visiting the outside of home. A responsible child can bring their laptop when visiting relatives, even outside of holidays, without worrying about falling behind in their education. This is a significant benefit.
There are many different laptops to choose from. 
They range in price, from affordable options that can still perform well, to high end models that are as expensive as a down payment on a house. Laptops are also used by big companies, thus ensuring there’s more than enough suppliers who fix or service these devices should one have a problem. This also means there is a huge supply on the used market as companies upgrade after the assets have been depreciated. Although some organizations may consider these items to be obsolete, they are frequently in good condition and are refurbished and sold by specialized suppliers like Go Gadgets.
Laptops also allow working during power interruption due to the internal battery, a must in South Africa with our frequent load shedding.
Laptops, however, can be quite expensive relative to desktops. Often their components are pricier than their desktop counterparts. Desktops are easier and cheaper to upgrade than laptops because they have more space for hardware changes. The portability of laptops also makes them vulnerable to damage as they are being moved from one place to another. Private car owners are often at risk of having their laptops stolen, which becomes an even greater concern when commuting using public transportation.
Chromebooks are laptops with a very light operating system based on the Chrome browser. The advantage of a Chromebook is that they are relatively fast without needing high-end hardware. Despite their limited system requirements, their utility has grown over the years as more applications now have web-based alternatives.
Chromebooks used to be criticized for limited storage, but considering that most apps have online versions, the criticism is irrelevant. If one needs to expand the memory there are external hard drives or other portable le storage devices. I have had a Chromebook since 2016, my 13-year-old nephew’s second computer was also a Chromebook when he was about 8. Unfortunately, there is not much variety locally for Chromebooks.
Importing the three Asus Chromebooks I've owned is ideal when the exchange rate is in my favour. However, it's not so great when the rand's value depreciates against the dollar. Importing may cause limited manufacturer's support as they might not be represented locally. This can cause expensive turnaround times when the device needs to be shipped between the owner and the manufacturer in case of problems. Thankfully there has been a gradual increase of Chromebooks locally.
8.2.4 Desktops.
Desktops are my preferred option, not only because they are often cheaper than laptops with similar specifications but also because of ease of upgradability. Unless one has opted for a mini or small factor PC, average computer cases are big enough to upgrade with little problems. In line with this, most cases allow for tool-free access, further simplifying the process.
The fixed nature of a desktop aligns with having a dedicated space for teaching and learning at home. I’ve often found myself taking my laptop to the couch or bed, a move that is great for my naps but horrible for productivity. It is easier to enforce house rules with a fixed computer because people know not to eat in the study. This ensures that the children take the necessary breaks away from the screens and when they are eating there are no distractions.
As previously mentioned, Desktops can be bulky and thus not ideal where space is at a premium. While there are mini-PC’s as small as a USB stick, the size advantage comes at the expense of upgradability. The Raspberry Pi is an exception to the rule that smaller size equals lower customizability. It is relatively small but highly customizable. 
One also loses on the internal battery a laptop has, but there are uninterrupted power supply devices for that.
8.2.5. Shared Computers, Desktops & Laptops
It is possible to use the same computer for 2 or more people working at the same time. While there's both hardware and software options to enable this, I found the software option more accessible. I tried to look for the hardware in South Africa but I couldn't get far, I suspect this is mostly used by corporate entities in the country, if at all. 
Fortunately, I found a retailer that sold software that enabled this without the thin client hardware. To enable this the requirements are; 
A screen for each child,
A mouse and keyboard for each child,
Headsets for each child
Aster Multiseat Software
I bought the ASTER Home annual subscription for 2 workplaces at a cost of around 300 ZAR.  After a month of using the software, I opted against it. I sometimes struggled to connect and allocate some of the hardware, like audio and gamepads, but the software worked well enough for 2 children on a basic computer. The licence I had also worked with Windows only, and I eventually switched all the computers at home to Linux as the primary operating system.
Both children can't turn off the computer individually since it shuts down for both of them at the same time because they are sharing it. If one child is not using it, they log out. Sometimes, I had to reset and reallocate the hardware settings, which was far from ideal. The children required assistance on a more frequent basis, which was contrary to my desired outcome.
8.3. Software Requirements
“An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API). In addition, users can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI (GUI).”

I must admit, until I had to provide computers for 4 children at a reasonable price, I never took Linux seriously. I had it on an old computer in the workshop I use for video tutorials but never used it for productivity. I bought the computer before 2010, and it barely functioned with Windows, until I switched to Linux. When I realized how rapidly the costs were accumulating and how slow the second-hand computers I finally purchased were running with Windows, I made the switch to Linux.
Despite being invested in Windows I freely made the change after discovering how easy to use Linux has grown to be and how feature rich it is. Endless OS is an excellent distro for education as it comes preloaded with tons of education software without the need to be connected to the internet. 
My primary computer runs on Ubuntu. According to Ubuntu.com "The mission for Ubuntu is both social and economic. First, we deliver the world’s free software, freely, to everybody on the same terms. Whether you are a student in India or a global bank, you can download and use Ubuntu for free. Second, we aim to cut the cost of professional services - support, management, maintenance, operations - for people who use Ubuntu at scale, through a portfolio of services provided by Canonical which ultimately fund the improvement of the platform."
The Children's computers run Endless OS. According to the Endless Organisation
"Endless OS is a fast, powerful and easy to use app-centric operating system built on Open-Source. Our OS comes with more than 1800 free apps and powerful tools that don’t require an Internet connection. The desktop experience is designed to feel natural and intuitive like a smartphone, making it easy to use even if you have little or no computer experience.  It does not require an internet connection to use! But when you are connected to the internet, Endless works like any other computer, so you can search the web or stay in touch with friends & family."
The Endless OS revived the oldest computers which barely worked with Windows 10. The OS resulted in a Dell 7010 boot time of just under 2 seconds, an OptiPlex 990 & T1700 boot up in less than 30 seconds.
As you can see with me, the choice one makes with regard to the type (and age) of computer they use plays a great role in the software they will be able to use. A computer's operating system is probably the most important component of a computer. This is because it dictates what kind of computer one can have, more than the hardware does. Mac OS, for example, is mostly (if not exclusively) for Apple devices and comes preloaded with them. Android on the other hand is mostly for mobile devices like smartphones and tables and cannot be readily used in desktop computers. 
There are parts that are simple enough to understand about an OS;
One requires a boot program to load an OS, and it is loaded in the beginning.
An OS manages all other application programs on a computer.
Due to these functions of the OS, it is not only important in dictating the hardware one can use but also the software as well.
Windows OS is by far the most widely known for desktops and laptops. Windows ascended to the top for desktops and laptops due to early marketing efforts in the 90s by its proprietor as a user-friendly home and work computer. 
The OS also gained popularity in the business world to be the most used OS in companies and governments worldwide.
Linux is the operating system of all the world’s fastest supercomputers (Blackdown).
96.3 percent of the top 1,000,000 web servers use Linux (ZDNet.
85 percent of smartphones are powered by Linux (Hayden James). enterpriseappstoday.com
It's hard to believe the last part since the majority of smartphone users, who also know others, own Android smartphones. This is, until one realizes that, similar to Chrome OS, at the core of the Android OS is a Linux Kernel. 
Central to each operating system is a kernel that manages the hardware and software.
8.3.1. Open-Source Software
Open-Source software is available with a license that requires no payment. Often, the only expenditure relating to open-source software is the data for the download. Open-Source software has come a long way and now, some of its programs can rival and integrate with paid options. For instance, LibreOffice is an excellent example as it is compatible with Microsoft Office files. Linux is another example. There are now variations of the operating system that even lifelong Windows or Mac users would find comfortable.
I am a prime example of someone who converted to Linux.
Open-source software has many benefits, but it's important to remember that it may require more effort to learn compared to commercial options due to its lower popularity. This is also compounded by fewer people who are familiar enough to troubleshoot thus mostly leaving the user to do more extensive research. This must not be interpreted to mean there is no support for open-source software as there are support communities online. 
The Ultimate Linux Newbie Guide has tons of information on Linux, from the basics relating to the initial installation to more advanced uses. It could be a great alternative to start with open-source software, not only for cost saving but also learning as well. To someone that is passionate about computers and solving problems, even the challenge of having to figure things out can be thrilling.
8.3.2. Things to consider when choosing an OS
The most common operating system for desktops and laptops is Microsoft Windows, while Android dominates the smartphone and low to mid-range tablets. Chrome OS is specific for Chromebooks, there is also Chrome Flex which is a desktop variant for bringing new life to old computers. MacOS is specific to Apple devices. Linux has also been around for some time even though its use is not as ubiquitous as the other OS’s. Consider the following regarding the OS:
User-friendliness and support.
Chrome OS - To date, the easiest OS I’ve ever used remains Chrome OS. It is after all based around a browser and if you know how to use a browser, you’re good to go. While previous versions of the Chrome OS had limitations on the software one can install, since they integrated the Android Play Store the choice has widened. Chrome OS also allows you to install Linux programs through a built-in virtual machine. This opens up even more options to install software that one needs and may not be available online or on the Android Play Store.
Linux - Linux Distributions, have evolved to be just as simple to use. There are few things that intimidated me in the past about Linux as did the Terminal with its command lines. Since switching to the latest versions of Linux I don't even have to interact with the terminal. Software updates are automatic, software installation is as simple as it is on Windows and Android. Distributions like Endless OS also come with all the software one needs for education, online and especially offline. 
Most people that have ever used a laptop or desktop in this country most likely used a variant of the Microsoft Windows OS. This means the learning curve to use the OS is not as steep, and when one struggles there are a lot of people who are familiar with it. 
I cannot say much about MacOS since I have never used it, but I think one of the primary selling points of Apple has been user-friendliness.

Price and compatible software.
Linux is open source and free to download. This also goes for most of the software that is required, an example being LibreOffice and Thunderbird to mention a few. This means if you have a not so new PC which you don’t have an OS for you can install Linux. Linux was the solution after Windows proved too heavy for my computers.
Chrome OS: In July 2022 Google released ChromeOS Flex, a free OS that can be installed on PC’s and MacBook’s made after 2010. If one has experience with a browser, they should easily adapt to using Chrome OS Flex. We tried to use Chrome OS Flex for the desktops, but some functionality was not available, the app store being the most significant.
Windows OS Windows is not free and has differently priced OSs for different users. There is also a large market for applications that can run on the Windows OS. Although Windows software can be expensive, there are frequently cost-free alternatives available, and some of them are exceptional, as is demonstrated by LibreOffice, which is compatible with both Windows and Linux.
Mac OS, I am not aware of MacOS being sold separately as it comes bundled with Apple devices. These are premium-priced devices with software that matches. Sales and Support are available countrywide, albeit concentrated in major towns/ cities through authorized Apple Resellers.

8.4. Cost-effective ways of acquiring the required equipment and physical resources.
Since I’ve been working towards this over the years, I’ve managed to accumulate a lot of items we repurposed for the study. This helped keep costs manageable. Even a chair that is not purposefully designed, say maybe due to lack of back support, will work if breaks are frequent. 
Second-hand office furniture is also an alternative, as it is with computers. Once company assets have reached their end of life, they are often sold at prices far cheaper than their original value. Sometimes the furniture is still in great condition, for example where the company updated its brand and needed new furniture to match.
I've designed and built the study area and most of the furniture with my kids. This was not necessarily to save costs as that depends on the materials used but is part of the learning experience for both myself and my kids. The study has been in constant evolution since the day I moved in, along with the rest of the home. Thus far we have, mostly with my kids;
Changed the layout and design of the Study.
Demolished and rebuilt a section to enhance usability,
Build and install most furniture and fixed shelves.  
Installing both wired and wireless networks.
Upgrades to the computers
The South African formal education system is biased towards abstract academic concepts and lacks emphasis on practical skills, which is a modern tragedy. The cleaning of the classrooms and school premises we did when I grew up that is frowned upon today instilled good values of cleaning up after oneself. My parents tell me of a time when practical skills like woodworking, cooking, plumbing and other trade work used to be taught from primary school throughout. This not only ensured that the students had usable skills they could profit off without needing to be employed but also promoted self-sufficiency and independence.
Fortunately for me, my father loved woodwork during the little spare time he had. This passion rubbed off on me which for the past 2 decades I’ve been working towards realizing. Since 2015, I have made numerous small investments in tools, and now these investments have finally come together to create the workshop of my dreams. 
Before calling external assistance with any building and maintenance work we first see if we can’t do it ourselves.
Learning by doing is far much better than trying to make sense of abstract concepts from a book; the workshop addresses this. This has not only been limited to the physical products and work but also the design. My 13-year-old nephew is currently at an intermediate level of designing with Sketchup, just from watching online tutorials and learning by doing. 
At the time of writing this book we in 2023 we completed numerous projects. The most challenging of these was an extension of the workshop storage and addition of a laundry room. Seeing I wanted to learn wood framing, this was an opportunity to do so.
It took us about 3 months to complete the project, from the floor to roofing and everything in-between. The design was done on SketchUp and we completed most of the construction. The only training and tutorials we received was from YouTube, from the millions of creators who share their experience.

9. The Curriculum
I’ve always planned for a different approach to educating my children, but it was not until the COVID lockdowns that I fully acted. By the third month we made the decision, especially because we already had the resources to enable the children to attend an online school.
Initially, I conflated homeschooling with attending an online school from home, without fully grasping the distinct nature of homeschooling. This meant I hadn’t thought through the type of curriculum we were going to use and its delivery. My knee-jerk reaction was to adopt the model of distance learning and have someone else provide the curriculum.
While this is by no means homeschooling, it helped a lot with the transition. My nephew had attended traditional schools and was in grade 5. During the period of attending an online school, it allowed us to verify if homeschooling was appropriate for him. It was imperative that the transition was gradual and not too sudden for him. He followed a standard curriculum, attended online classes at fixed times and had teachers.
9.1. Available Curriculums
An online school is a great stepping stone to homeschooling. Other than learning from home, most of the other elements of school are still the same, including following a strict curriculum.
In South Africa, the 3 most common curriculum options are;
The Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS) is in two parts.  There is the National Curriculum Statements (NCS) Grades R - 12 which is offered through most public schools.
The IEB, which stands for Independent Examinations Board, offers its services to private schools as an independent assessment agency. It possesses the authority to administer examinations for a wide range of client schools. Both the IEB and NSC use the CAPS curriculum with the difference being that they will write different exams to NSC candidates.
The Cambridge Assessment International Education provides a standalone curriculum which is not linked to CAPS. The curriculum is widely accepted in international destinations like the US, UK, Australia to mention a few as per their website.

One of the advantages of following the school at home model / distance learning is that there are numerous providers that sell structured packages. The most comprehensive of these have all the material the learner needs in either hard or soft copies, or both, depending on choice. 
Moreover, considering that the only difference between distance learning and traditional schooling lies in the learning environment, the workload is equally comparable for parents in both scenarios. Some of the packages include attending classes online in real time with interaction between the teacher and the students.
We initially chose a service provider that offered packages ranging from 5000 rands to under 10000 rands in 2021. The cheapest package included basic assessment materials and subject guidance, while the most expensive was a full package.
All learning material as per curriculum, including workbooks.  
Hard copies of all the learning, teaching and assessment material
Tools to guide the parent as a facilitator.
Online / Recorded Lessons
Same structure as traditional school
I was fascinated to discover that even prestigious and costly private schools procure their curriculum from the very same service provider that I did. If the reason for spending a lot of money on private schools was to ensure a quality education, now you can achieve the same level of learning at home for a fraction of the cost, using the exact same educational resources as those prestigious schools. The downside of course is that at the end you will lack the prestige that comes from having attended a prestigious school.
9.2. Homeschooling
To truly optimize our homeschooling, it is crucial to seamlessly integrate education into a child's daily routine, focusing on developing relevant skills rather than strictly following a predefined curriculum. Our lessons have evolved into an option that is synchronized with the activities taking place in and around the family, country and world.
While Solo still has some classes, albeit not live and more akin to research than anything, his primary learning comes from doing things. He has been my right hand in evolving the Study to what it is and assists with maintaining and improving it. While he could be focusing on the theory of angles in a traditional school, he now learns by doing. He learned how to design and visualize the model before building it, which now helps us construct everything we have planned. This also extends to the installation and maintenance of the IT infrastructure that we use, in the process learning both computer hardware and software.
Homeschooling has also been great for me as it keeps me on my toes, the same being applicable to my mother and sisters. As teachers, it is important that we refresh our knowledge, in the process also enjoying the experience. More adults in the household have also become more passionate about their contributions as the children are excited to learn.
My mother’s garden has been the primary source of our vegetables since 2021. While the garden might feed our stomachs it does as much to our minds, especially the children who are by grandma’s side getting their hands dirty. The food quality has remarkably enhanced, motivating Solo to take pleasure in cooking, which has also excited the younger children to do the same.
In 2015 when I moved into this house, I outsourced most of the building and maintenance work. We now have a workshop reasonably equipped for carpentry, welding, plumbing to name a few. Along with the increase in the equipment has been an increase in the skill-set as we learn by doing. Thankfully there are now extensive resources to access knowledge online, most of which are free if one is prepared to do the research.


10. Online Resources
We often take it for granted that people go to school to learn as their primary objective. It then follows that the higher the qualification one obtains from the school system, the more knowledgeable they are. Over time, this has led to a focus on getting qualifications rather than gaining knowledge.
In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of high-ranking government officials and politicians who have been exposed for fabricating their qualifications. This has not been limited to government but has spread throughout society in line with the moral decay occurring. Given the way traditional schooling is structured and provided, it is not surprising that individuals will go to great measures to evade it.
As far back as I can recall, the bell that signalled the end of the school day always caused more excitement than the one that signalled the start. In college, there were few things that made me happier as a full-time student than having one of my classes cancelled. Instances of children and young adults pretending to be sick to skip school are as old as the institution itself.
Why do we try so hard to skip school when it actually helps us learn and learning brings many advantages?
The result of evaluating knowledge learned from school years after and its practical applications is not that positive either. Social media is inundated with captivating videos where individuals, including those currently immersed in the educational system, are challenged to recall fundamental knowledge they were once taught in school but struggle to recall even a mere twelve months later, let alone after the passage of a dozen years.
An article in the Daily Investor revealed that only 55 percent of teachers can perform at grade 4 level. This means that teachers, who had to go through the classes they now teach, also struggle to remember what they learned in school. The teacher also expands their knowledge by teaching the subject and attending additional courses mostly paid for by taxpayers. Despite all that, a large number of teachers lack proficiency in the subjects they teach!
Considering the dismal long-term retention of school-taught concepts by teachers, one can only imagine the even bleaker outcome for individuals who last encountered Trigonometry during their high school years a decade later. For a significant number of teachers, once one gets the necessary qualifications and secures a job, there is no motivation for them to be knowledgeable in the subjects they teach.
They don't have to worry about the poor performance of their students reflecting on them during their performance evaluation, as it is mostly a superficial checkmark process. There are low standards for students to move to the next class. Policies discourage failing students who are unable to pass a class.
This creates no motivation to be competent for the teachers, nor interest from the students to apply themselves. 

10.1 Free & Low-cost Online resources
"The best education in the world is already free. All complaints about elite colleges’ impossible admissions and insane tuition are flatly mistaken. Fact: anyone can study at Princeton for free. While tuition is over $45,000 a year, anyone can show up and start attending classes. No one will stop you. No one will challenge you. No one will make you feel unwelcome. Gorge yourself at Princeton’s all-you-can-eat buffet of the mind. Colleges do not card. I have seen this with my own eyes at schools around the country.

If you keep your learn-for-free scheme to yourself, professors will assume you’re missing from their roster owing to a bureaucratic snafu. If you ask permission to sit in, most professors will be flattered. What a rare pleasure to teach someone who wants to learn! After four years of “guerrilla education,” there’s only one thing you’ll lack: a diploma. Since you’re not in the system, your performance will be invisible to employers. Not too enticing, is it?" 
The Case Against Education - Book by Bryan Caplan
  
What if one has a desire to learn rather than to hold a qualification? Can one really acquire education for free from highly ranked institutions and professionals? I am happy to say the answer is yes. I don't have personal experience attending a university lecture without paying, but like many others with internet access, I can access free content from highly ranked institutions worldwide.
I not only have access to their recorded content, but I can also engage with most professionals that have social media accounts to gain deeper insights on the subject. There are numerous websites, desktop and mobile apps, both local and international, that offer free online learning materials.
Teaching Institutions, profit and nonprofit entities, and governments websites are full of articles and papers that one can use for research. Many of these sources offer a lot of free information and are willing to provide even more to those who are interested. This helps to promote their cause.
Academic Search Engines. Paperpile.com rated Google Scholar as the best option among academic search engines. According to Paperpile Google Scholar "It not only lets you find research papers for all academic disciplines for free but also often provides links to full-text PDF files," amongst other things. There are many other such websites which provide this service for free. Finding research papers for free is essential for conducting research in any field, even though not all papers are freely available.
Search Engines. The basic search engines have gone through a lot of evolution over the past, recently integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI). Search engines like Google have become essential not only for work but also for doing homework, and everything in between. It is common knowledge that 'googling' has become a verb in our daily routine, and for good reason. These are very good at showing both free and paid for resources on any topic. One can define if they want free or paid content in the search description itself.
Rumble, Vimeo, YouTube and other video sharing sites. One of the best resources when I was studying law was video sharing sites. Some of the lecturers posted recorded sessions which were great, especially since I was studying remotely. One of my favourite YouTube channels is @crashcourse, amongst others. The Green brothers, John and Hank simplify and make complex subjects entertaining. They cover a wide range of topics, including biology, civilization, chemistry, physics, etc. I cannot remember the last time I did troubleshooting without a video tutorial; they are very handy and mostly free.
Television Learning Channels. Most content available on television for children's education can be accessed online at no cost. While accessing them online allows more flexibility, this does not invalidate traditional television. The national broadcaster has always had fixed education slots for young and old. The same is just as true of eTV, which is freely available in the country. Other notable local television and online channels for educational content include Mindset Learn, eTV Toonz and SABC Education, amongst others.
Online Educational Websites and Learning Platforms - There are many online learning platforms dedicated to providing resources for all ages, local and international. Some of these platforms, like Mindset Learn are dedicated to supporting children who are enrolled at a traditional school. Most of these are freely accessible with payment only required if one wants a certificate of competency on completion for the sites that specialise on online courses. Some local companies in the technology and telecommunications sector are now providing online education as well. I cannot name them all, but some noteworthy options include; SA Homeschoolers, e-Classroom, Dorkk, Vodacom e-school, MTN online school, Twinkl, South African History Online, Coursera, Khan Academy, etc

I recently discovered a wealth of historical documents in the Van Warmelo Collection, which can be accessed for free on the University of Pretoria website. Over the course of 30 to 40 years, Dr Van Warmelo, the State Ethnologist in the Department of Bantu Affairs, dutifully and meticulously collected these documents. Upon his demise, these were donated to the university. This collection contains the original manuscripts that describe various aspects of the history, customs, and traditions of the indigenous people of what is now South Africa. South African Heritage Publishers have transcribed historical documents for easier access and offer a membership for less than R400 a year.  
While their content is not free, The Great Courses offers lecturers by University Professors at a fraction of the cost. You can choose to buy courses separately or subscribe to Wondrium for unlimited streaming of all their content. I'm a huge fan of The Great Courses for multiple reasons. One of the things that sets them apart is the way their courses are structured - just like a traditional university course, complete with a comprehensive study guide.
One of the caveats with most free online content providers is that some are not structured. When using video streaming websites, one is often bombarded with a plethora of irrelevant and sometimes distracting content, including advertisements. This also applies to free websites that justifiably have to make their revenue elsewhere with adverts being the easiest way.
Free and inexpensive options usually don't give a completion certificate. However, if you're looking for knowledge, the only limitation is the amount of time and bandwidth you have for learning. Online learning resources come in a wide range of quality and price options, providing ample opportunities for knowledge seekers. From complementary resources to premium options, there is something for everyone's learning needs.
10.2. Online Security and Productivity Tools
As a compliance practitioner, I have been fortunate enough to work closely with Cybersecurity, giving me valuable insights into the risks involved. Fortunately, my expertise has also enabled me to take necessary precautions to ensure the online safety of my family. Without proper knowledge to protect yourself, online learning can become a terrible experience, due to the many people who use information for malicious purposes. Once again Linux offered the best value for money in this regard as there is no need for an antivirus.
This was a lesson I learned after I had already gone all in, in a 2-year subscription on Norton 360 for Windows due to its strong parental control features. Windows is popular with hackers, so it is important to have antivirus and online protection. This is not the case with Linux as the software is not as targeted, for now at least.
Apart from security, it is very easy to get distracted by entertainment content online, irrespective of the device. Social media, games, videos to mention a few are often more enticing and addictive than school work thus making it easier to lose focus. It is very important that for the duration of class learners are focused on their studies, and have as few distractions as possible.
This was also one of the reasons I eventually steered away from Windows. Microsoft operating systems come with pre-installed games that provide access to Microsoft affiliated games and sites, such as MSN, even if they are blocked. Their online content is even more extensive and difficult to block, even when one tries. The drive for the company to monetise its entertainment products is such that even from the login screen there's already advertisements luring one away from productive work.
The following helped with our online security and productivity.
We use software from the proprietors directly or the official app stores for the operating system. Linux, for example, comes with most browsing, word processing and other productivity software, and the app store. Software downloaded illegally or from unscrupulous sites often contains additional applications which may slow down your computer. At worst, they can install viruses and malware that can give others access to your computer remotely for nefarious reasons.
Use an official operating system that is supported for security upgrades. One of the reasons the software keeps on getting upgraded by the manufacturers often has to do with security. Most devices will have a defined period during which the manufacturer will commit to providing updated security patches. Make sure the computer’s operating system is still supported by the manufacturer.
Antivirus, firewalls and network protection. As mentioned, this is not necessary for Linux. One of the advantages of using an authentic operating system is that often, these have built in antivirus, firewall and network protection software. There are also independent companies that provide this software, some for free and others for a price. Depending on one’s budget and needs, one can choose from the multitude of options available.
Child Monitoring and Productivity Software. Every child knows the meaning of a bell at school that signals the start of classes. Once this goes off, everyone must be seated at their desks and do their work. The teacher in front of the class not only ensures that for that period the children learn, but they also look out for distractions. Microsoft Family and Google Family-link are excellent productivity tools to provide an added layer of security and monitor the child’s online activities. There are many other proprietors that provide this child safety software which often has the following functionality:
Creating child-specific profiles for age-appropriate content.
Setting up school time when the child will only have access to learning software and websites.
Setting up on and off schedules where the child can use the computer and when they must switch off.
Provide daily/weekly/monthly progress reports for each child on their computer usage and progress.
No matter how good these tools are, they are not infallible. To limit the risks, I have the following setup;
Most basic are the passwords and dedicated workstations. For the youngest children between 4 and 6 it’s still a challenge to instill the secrecy of the login credentials even though they each have them. Fortunately, though all the children know when they log in, they do so with their own profiles so that their activities can be reviewed.  
If you are using Windows, there is Microsoft Family and Google has Google-Link.  The advantage of the latter is that since it works with Google Chrome it can be used even on Linux, as long as the browser is Google Chrome. it is set up for all the children’s computers in line with their age.
Then there is the antivirus program which is not applicable for Linux.
I installed extra extensions to block social media sites that may not be detected by the first two security measures.
The youngest children exclusively use the computers for schooling, setting ‘school time’ as the only option in the family management software.
By configuring specific sites to open by default when the browser is switched on, children are not only able to navigate with ease but also kept from accessing other inappropriate sites.
Using a dedicated operating system that is focused on learning, in this case Endless OS.

While these tools are good, I have also learned how effective self-monitoring is among kids. The moment one does something they are not supposed to, the others will tell them. Since we all share the same space, I can easily notice if something is amiss while I'm focused on my work.
As soon as someone diverges from the norm, I will receive a notification, either from an app, or the children themselves. Using a combination of monitoring tools is crucial due to my observation that Microsoft MSN continues to operate through the Edge browser even when blocked. This poses the risk of potential gaming distractions at the least and unsupervised internet access at the worst.

10.3. Educational Websites and Applications
The first time I went to a library was when I was in standard 7. Until that point, the idea was purely hypothetical. We had to depend on the textbooks provided by the school and whatever resources we could borrow from friends or family members. This limited the scope of thinking to only what was accessible, reducing the exploration of different solutions to a problem. I was very lucky compared to others because my parents highly appreciated books. In my home, it was seriously wrong to burn or destroy a book.
The library in the town was very small for the villages it was servicing. The library in my village was less than 10 kilometres away, but many parents in rural areas couldn't afford the associated costs. The taxi fare, to and from town was relatively expensive, making it too costly. Also, the walk to the "taxi rank," which was only two kilometres away, didn't make the library seem attractive. Things were a little better when I was in high school because at least there was a library at the civic centre of the township. The library didn't have enough resources for the large number of people it served. Luckily, two nearby towns had more resources. The main challenge in the second scenario is not having enough money to travel to the city and get a new library membership card.
Thankfully the internet has brought about the accessibility of resources that otherwise would be constrained by geography. The location of an educational website doesn't matter because you can access it easily from home using a smartphone or computer. While some education websites require subscription fees, most do not.
Navigating the vast sea of information on the internet can be quite daunting. One must carefully sift through the plethora of data to uncover the hidden gems of valuable insights, all while being mindful of the irrelevant distractions that abound. The advantage of using paid educational websites is that often they do the work of organizing the information and grouping it for easy navigation.
As a homeschooler, you can feel confident knowing that all the information has been organized for you, based on subject, grade level, age group, and more. The students as well benefit immensely from using properly organized websites with interfaces that have been made age appropriate. The risk of children clicking on the wrong website is very high with free content providers as they rely on the adverts for revenue. 
Regrettably, certain advertisements feature inappropriate content that can be harmful to children. Visiting these websites can endanger the security of both the child and the entire family.

I use education.com as the primary learning resource. For now, the site suits my needs. There is a free option but is too limited for my needs, so I opted for the paid version which gives me access to:
Huge library with worksheets, games, lesson plans etc.
Caters for Pre-K to 8th Grade.
Allows creation of multiple profiles for each of my children.
The site has classroom mode for up to 35 students!
I can assign activities to each of them individually or as a group.
With profiles created and activities assigned, progress is easy to track for each child.
Covers a wide range of subjects.
Gives me control over the content I want to assign, which I can review prior and approve of the content.
Activities can be assigned online or printed; the material is printer-friendly.
There are no intrusive ads.
The website is just as easy to navigate on a mobile device as it is on a desktop/ laptop.  Once each student signs in they are locked into a grade should you choose, or let them navigate on their own.
Students don't need to have an email address; I simply create them on my profile and log them on their computer.

One of the things I love about the site is the simple interface after login. The main screen shows 3 main subjects a child can choose from with assignments displayed at the bottom. Teaching them to use it is a one-time activity. The profiles can be locked to a specific grade, or I can let the children navigate freely.
I can schedule activities in advance on the site. I can set the deadline and the number of tries each child gets for each activity. This is a great feature since I can assign a whole month’s work on the first and not have to worry about supervision until it is due. 
I worry about supervision, but I found a great way for my sisters and mother to supervise, review content, and monitor progress for the children. To fully optimize education.com 's capacity for up to 35 students, I had the idea of adding my sisters and mother as students, guaranteeing their access to all the assigned material intended for the children.
They can all propose a specific topic, lesson plan, subject etc. they want introduced, and I add it to the assignments. They help to review and complete the activities to verify if content is age appropriate and in line with my family's values.
10.4. Websites vs Mobile Applications
One of the advantages of online resources, websites and mobile applications is that information is often current and frequently updated. Unlike a hard copy that needs to go through lengthy and expensive printing and distribution processes, updating online content is not as time-consuming. While this applies to both platforms, there are differences.
10.4.1. Websites
While the information on apps and websites is often the same as content providers often cater to both, websites often require a live internet connection. This means that one will only have access to the content they previously downloaded when they are not connected to the internet. This can be a problem, especially for referencing and research. When one needs to know the meaning of a word for an essay they are compiling or an assignment they are completing it is desirable to have the dictionary close by.
10.4.2. Mobile Applications
Mobile apps are great when it comes to having offline access to the content and the convenience of accessing it anywhere. Most apps will download the content on the mobile device and only use the internet to update the content. You can choose what content you want to access while traveling, even if you don't have a stable internet connection.
Mobile apps however are also not without their shortcomings, especially when accessed from a small screen that may not be great for productivity. The amount of material you can download depends on the device's memory. This is especially important for mobile devices because they often have less internal memory than computers.


11. Bridging the socialization gap and group sports
By now you will have picked up my disdain for sports, and that is putting it mildly. Not only sports, but group activities in general were the most gruelling parts of my days at school. Thankfully my nosebleeds could be summoned at will most of the time, so I could get out of sports, not so much though out of group activities.
I believe that it is important for children to be active, but I also think that too much emphasis is placed on sports. This is despite the fact that few individuals are able to make a successful living out of their sporting talents. I didn't like as a child that athletes were instantly rewarded with medals and trophies for playing sports. This created an impression that the little education one received at school was even less important than the sporting activities since they were seasonally rewarded.
One of the things that made my high school experience truly enjoyable was the annual recognition of academic excellence. Our school benefited from the support of a major corporate sponsor, a company that employed many residents of our township. Thanks to their generous sponsorship, we not only received certificates but also cash prizes! At first, I didn't want to leave home and move to another province for a new school. However, the rewards program made it all worth it. I was even fortunate enough to receive a poetry prize, on top of the trophies I earned for my outstanding performance in certain subjects. Considering I walked a significant distance to and from school in my primary with physically demanding chores when I returned home such as;
Fetching water from a river with a wheelbarrow and 20-40 litre containers.
Taking the 12-volt car battery we used to power the TV to town for charging on public transport.
Clearing all the weeds in the yard, garden and my father’s grave by myself because I was the only male who could shovel these.
Travelling everywhere on foot, in a village where the distance between two homes could be occupied by hundreds in urban areas.

I can go on. The point is my life was simple enough to integrate all the physical activity I needed to maintain my health, and then some! For me, it was pointless to dedicate so much time to sports if the argument for it being a viable career path is weak.
With that said, the one activity I always wanted to get involved in was martial arts lessons. Blame it on my fascination with Kung Fu and Action movies: I was hooked! Where I came from though, in the rural villages there weren’t any Kung-Fu Masters who were willing to share their skills. Even when I got to high school though I still was restrained because the closest ‘Dojo’ was quite far, and I couldn’t even afford the monthly fees.
Fortunately for my children, there are numerous private providers offering a wide range of activities, ranging from Karate to car racing and everything in between. Even in traditional school, Solo didn't have martial arts. He did it after school with a private service provider. This means the fear that children might be robbed of participating in sports or interacting with other children is mitigated.
In homeschooling groups, there are various activities and events available for children to socialize. Additionally, these groups often use or offer their services as private service providers for different sporting activities. We rely on the local classifieds and internet for recreational and sports activities in line with the children's interests, we're often astonished at the diverse offerings. 
There are also other homeschoolers in the area; there are always opportunities to join. Even if there are no groups, we can start our own. 
Isn't that the essence of homeschooling? To shift our children's mindset from being followers to becoming leaders, transforming them from consumers into creators, innovators, and inventors? If we are saying they must do those things, who better to show them than us, and what is a better way than leading by example?

11.1. Interaction with other children
One of the first concerns most people raise about homeschooling is the lack of interaction with other children. Somehow the fear is that the child will not be socialized since they are not interacting with other children. In the long term, this might impact the child's ability to interact with other people.

This has never been a concern for me, primarily because I have other children in the house. If it was one child that was being homeschooled, I'd consider this. As mentioned earlier, children have numerous chances to socialize with peers beyond their own family circle.

My sisters and mother are more social than me. They often take the children to parks, events, and other places to meet other kids. In my area, for example, one of the best places to go for socializing and outdoor activities is the Rietvlei Zoo Farm. Activities range from trails to scenic picnic spots. There's also swimming, soccer, and fishing, to name a few.

It is not uncommon to find my house invaded by Solo's friends who come over for visits and weekend sleepovers. SN’s teenage son is also not too far and the boys have known each other for a few years now. He also has friends from the previous complex and area he stayed in when he arrived in Johannesburg.

My nephew has more visits from his friends for game nights and going out, way more than I did despite going to school. Even outside of visits and going out with them, they keep in touch online, including chatting while playing video games.

While socialization may be a concern there are many ways around it. Living in an extended family has many benefits, especially for the children. They have siblings to keep them company and multiple adults to support them in pursuing their various interests and activities. 
Part 4: The not so good and the great
12. Problems thus far
One of the most unforgettable memories I carry with me to this day is the vivid recollection of my daily school routine during my primary school days.
Reciting the prayers and performing the drills in classrooms at the assembly lines.  
Listening to teachers and the principal without questioning their authority and ‘facts’ they were disseminating.
Obeying class rules and waiting for permission to leave.
Taking part in compulsory extracurricular and social activities at school.
Submitting myself to be graded against the other students based on my work, 
Participation in extra mural activities and conduct.
It’s not that I could forget that routine because it continued to be reinforced throughout my formal schooling career. Although it was not strictly enforced in higher education as we had the choice to attend certain lectures or not. However, there were still serious consequences for not following the rules.
No one would report you to your parents if you missed a class or 2, nor failed to submit a report here and there. If you missed a lot of classes or didn't hand in many reports, failing the semester or year was still a consequence. The costs of post-school education are much higher compared to pre-tertiary schooling, which is arguably a bigger consequence when one fails.
By the time I began my first job in the formal sector, I already had all the necessary qualities that were expected by my employers during my years of formal schooling ingrained in me.  
Showing up on time.
Fear of authority figures.
Compliance to rules and conformance to norms.
Play nice with the colleagues to keep the peace.
 Expectation to participate in voluntary social, extra mural and charity activities of the employer.
Sitting at my desk and completing often monotonous work that kept me busy than it added to the productivity of the entity I worked for.

In school and at work, many activities seem unrelated to the main goal but still need to be done without questioning why.

Despite its imperfections, the formal school system was effective in teaching routine. The fear of authority it instils also helps parents when they need to scare the child into compliance by invoking a teacher or policeman 
‘Nyana, if you do not make your bed, I will report you to teacher Ann’.
12.1. Enforcing Compliance to schedules at home
Some of the shortcomings of the formal schooling system homeschooling addresses also lead to this weakness when it comes to instilling conformance to routines.
There are no fixed schedules, let alone the need to wake up very early just so one can make the drills in the assembly line.
My kids are encouraged to ask lots of questions to come to their own conclusions. This includes questioning things that I, as an adult, might do, but that doesn't make sense to them.
I don't grade or give busy work to the students. Instead, I monitor their learning progress by assessing their proficiency in the subject and their ability to successfully complete related projects.
Although the formal school system may sometimes go overboard in dedicating time and resources to instilling discipline, it cannot be denied that a certain level of adherence to routines is essential for becoming a well-rounded adult who can coexist harmoniously with others.
Following routines is important for survival. This knowledge has been passed down through tradition and culture for centuries. It is said “the early bird catches the worm” signifying the importance of sometimes having to wake up very early to have a bountiful catch in one’s hunts, however that translates to modern life. Aesop’s fable The Ant and the Grasshopper illustrates the consequences of not doing what one needs to when they must. The fable shows that if we don't do things on time, like sowing seeds and collecting food in spring and summer, there will be consequences later.
Fortunately, there are a variety of time-sensitive activities that can be utilized within the home to instill a sense of adherence to schedules. Solo for example has the following repetitive activities assigned to him:
Feeding the dogs at 6 am and 6 pm.
Take the trash to the street for collection as per schedule.
Reporting on electricity consumed first thing in the morning daily.
Helping his grandmother in the garden by watering it as per schedule.
The list is not complete, but it includes some activities we have added to promote compliance with certain routines when needed. Even the youngest children are aware of the routines and their roles.
Sleeping time for weekdays and weekends.
First thing after waking up is making their beds. Naturally an adult will follow up to do it properly.
Remove and pack dishes from the dishwasher when clean.
Although homeschooling offers flexibility, there are situations where conformity is necessary. Fortunately, there are alternative methods to instill discipline that are more effective and beneficial than adopting harsh military-style schedules and drills.

12.2 Enforcing Discipline
One of the realities of parenthood is how susceptible we are to our children's feelings. At 5, my son still invokes the same feelings in me that he did as an infant, when all I wanted to do was to protect him in his helplessness. The problem is that, although he still requires my protection, he has also learned how to take advantage of my tendency to protect him to avoid consequences for his wrong actions.
What happens when the parent, who is also the teacher, is susceptible to the child's charm and cannot invoke authority figures to make them comply? I can always invoke the policemen or creepy spider as a deterrent. My kids find spiders initially creepy, but then they become fascinated by them. They also realize quickly that I am not serious when I threaten to call the police.
Luckily, there are other adults in my home who care about the children as much as I do, but are not easily swayed by their charms. My son's bug-eyed look always seems to have a greater effect on me, making it difficult to discipline him, compared to his grandmother and aunts.
Despite being the most lenient on the children, they know not to mess with grandma because she can as quickly turn the other way. It can be fascinating to witness my son complying with a request or instruction, not because I told him to, but because of his grandma's influence. The fear of disappointing grandma, who is generous with treats and gifts, often motivates the children to obey.
Similarly, with my sisters, my son knows what each of them doesn’t like and does. It’s not uncommon that when I want him to go to bed, and he is not eager to go to bed, I call an aunt to coax him.
My nephews and niece also know once they throw tantrums all their mothers and grandmother need to invoke is ‘I’m going to call Malume on you’. Often this is enough to encourage them to comply, just by knowing that I might be called on them. 
I’ve also found I have to intervene far less as the children call each other to order. Solo, being the oldest child in the family also plays a role. There are many things that the children will do based on wanting to be like ‘big bro’. Amongst themselves, they are very quick to correct each other to avoid getting into trouble. Altruistic as this might seem, it is quite self-serving on their side because of the risk that they might all be blamed for the actions of one.
Raising the children in the extended family environment has been great for discipline and learning without invoking some external authority. Unless something goes really wrong there is also no risk of the adults being heavy-handed because as kin, they have a vested interest in the child.
Regrettably, it is quite common for children to experience abuse from their frustrated nannies in the absence of their parents. This issue equally extends to cases where teachers have crossed the line in their efforts to discipline students at school. In my household, the chances of getting frustrated and losing control with a child are low because no adult feels overwhelmed. Parenting responsibility is shared. Even if there is a possibility of going too far, there is always another adult available to step in and provide assistance.


13. Benefits to date
My greatest challenge was conquering the fear of deviating from the norm. The rigid structure of formal school, seamlessly followed by the routines of being an employee in the formal sector, had dictated my entire existence. Even though I had gradually worked towards building a life that would enable homeschooling, I would have taken longer to implement without a catalyst.
One of the things that had pushed me close to the typing point with the school system was when my family moved into our current home. My nephew and his grandmother moved from the Eastern Cape to Johannesburg and stayed in a property I owned, located in a different suburb just 10 minutes away from their current home. Since Ridgeway was closer to Winchester Ridge primary that was the school, he initially attended.
My sister tried her best to secure admission in a school located within walking distance of our newly consolidated family residence, but unfortunately, her efforts were in vain. This happened the following year and next such that by the time the COVID lockdowns happened I was already on the verge. I still can't comprehend how someone who doesn't live anywhere near the school can be given preference, especially considering that my property taxes contribute to the school. Should the school be in distress for any reason I am the one who is most likely going to respond because I can see the school instead of a resident that is located kilometres away.
The upside of the Draconian COVID lockdowns is that they served as a catalyst and since I have never looked back. I will highlight some of the benefits we are enjoying so far.

13.1. Costs 
One of the exercises that helped a lot towards my irrational fear of homeschooling costs was to do a comparison. Some of the fixed costs associated with traditional schooling are 
school fees, 
uniforms, 
books, 
pens as well as other stationery resources, 
transport to and from school, 
lunch money when no lunchbox is made and 
money for school fundraising activities.
The easiest option to compare was the online/homeschool option as the main variables were constant. 
To the astonishment of everyone at home, purchasing the complete package, which includes online classes and all the learning materials, turned out to be cheaper than the cost of transportation alone. The additional usage of the internet had a minimal impact since we had already upgraded our home to fibre for my work and everyone's communication, entertainment, and security requirements.
This year we upgraded the study with desktops for each of the children and myself. A telescope and microscope were added the previous year and so on. Even though the initial cost is high, it is usually lower than the yearly expenses of the most affordable public school in the area for all children.

13.2. Entrenching Family Values
There are no people to ever walk this earth that I hold even half as highly as I do my parents. Like many others before them and currently, they challenged the prevailing beliefs upheld by the education system regarding the ideal home and family necessary for raising successful children. Although they lacked material wealth at the start of their life together, their unwavering dedication to the responsibility of raising me and my siblings was far more valuable than the mere advantage of being born into material affluence.
Throughout my life, I have met numerous individuals who came from affluent backgrounds that met and often exceeded the specifications of the supposed ‘ideal family’. Parents who had the money to outsource every parental decision to ‘specialists’ and ‘expects’. Where parental wisdom, family involvement and traditional knowledge accumulated over thousands of years was replaced with the latest fashionable parenting ideas.
Growing up in seemingly 'ideal' families with 'basic' necessities like running water and electricity, and access to top-quality education and financial stability, one would expect individuals to not only become self-sufficient but also succeed in life. Regrettably, it is all too common to see adults who were raised in these so-called 'perfect' circumstances struggling to support themselves, let alone provide for their own children and elderly parents. Parents who have invested their resources in raising their children should be able to cherish their senior years and bask in the benefits of their efforts. Regrettably, instead of doing so, many are compelled to continue working longer merely to support their adult children and grandchildren.
There are no greater lessons that I have learned in my life that have been as valuable as those I learned from and through my parents. Above all, I learned to ground myself and de ne success for me. Knowing how far they had come to provide the life they did for me and my siblings inspired me to do better than them, as they did relative to my grandparents.
While my kids may find it strange, I used to walk more than 3 kilometres a day to school at some point. When I tell them I have studied under a tree because there weren’t enough classrooms they couldn’t identify, the one who is old enough to at least. He gives me the exact look I did to my father when he told me he used to walk in the morning frost to school barefoot. He’d literally jump with joy deep into dung when he came across cow excrement. The warmth from the fresh dung would provide some relief, no matter how brief, from the freezing morning frost.
I could never identify with that story and as a child it sounded more made up than it was real because that was not my reality. I have always had shoes from as far back as I can remember such that even today, I can barely stand to walk on gravel barefoot. The reality they had provided from us was so far detached from theirs that I couldn’t help but be inspired.
In a system that seemed to highlight my parent's financial limitations as a weakness, I benefited from knowing the historical context. Schools have unfairly viewed the valuable practices that were once widespread in previous generations and treasured by countless individuals before me as burdensome. The value of hard work, duty and owning up to one's actions were vilified by even the curriculum of school that emphasized victimhood.
If my parents had not instilled the values they did, I’d probably believe men and women are the same, despite reality. I’d believe nonsensical agendas meant to extort more money from taxpayers about men having previously oppressed women. The women in my family have always been able to fulfil their roles as exceptional mothers and homemakers because of the unwavering support from the men in our family, from my grandmother to my sisters.
This is what years in the public school system and liberal college campus life had hammered into me as soon as I left home. Although I may have once fallen for the deception in my naïveté, as soon as I employed rationality and drew upon personal encounters, the reality became clear. I have no memory of my father victimizing my mother. Even beyond his grave the man made sure that we would be provided for long enough for me to rightfully succeed him.
My mother has never been a victim, let alone my father. To classify a woman, who single handedly raised me and my sisters after my father's demise, as merely a victim would be an utter afront to her. She bravely navigated the challenges of widowhood without yielding to the temptation of introducing another man into our family home, all while maintaining her reputation as a respected and formidable married woman. I’ve worked towards having resources that she didn’t have and yet between the 2 of us she is the only one that has raised children to the age where we now have our own, and still need her expertise to do the job.
These are amongst the most important lessons I have learned in my life and I didn’t need to leave my home to learn them. In fact, the opposite is true, in that in leaving my home some of the lessons were diluted and sometimes demonised such that I had to relearn them, thankfully I could revive the experience. While I am grateful for the success, I have achieved through having gone through the traditional system, the reality is that I had most of the building blocks I needed to make the most of the little education that the school system provided to me.
While this may seem like I give my parents too much credit while giving none to the politicians, bureaucrats and teachers in the education department, thankfully this can be proven objectively.
Everyone who has gone through the traditional education system, public or private, has one common variable with other people who have gone through similar indoctrination. This means that if success was due to this common variable, in this case school, then throughout their lives their outcomes should be comparable.
This is however not the case, especially in defence of the education system. Rather than success amongst school being the norm, it is often the exception. If schools were the reasons people succeed, then considering the ubiquity of traditional schooling most people should be successful. Indicators such as tax contributions, income sources, and asset ownership can be objectively quantified.
If schools were the reason people succeed, then the country wouldn’t have more grant recipients than taxpayers. One of the current government’s virtue-signalling points has been their efforts in ensuring most children in the country go to school, which they achieved. Increasing school time prevented young people from learning useful skills from their parents or gaining valuable work experience when they were young. This ultimately robbed them of a successful future. Through deceitfully labelling it as education funding, politicians and bureaucrats managed to extort more money from taxpayers, thus lining their own pockets.
More people in the country, than ever before, have gone through the school system to learn basic numeracy and literacy. Every education minister in recent years claimed to have improved the matric pass rate more than the previous year. As this was not enough, it is a fact that today more people have gone to tertiary and have completed a qualification than ever before. Again, this is a fact.
So, considering all the successes that have been made in making sure more people go to school, why is the unemployment rate so high? The last statistic I checked showed South Africa has the highest youth unemployment rate in the world. Despite having qualifications that surpass their parents' dreams, it is ironic that the youth still rely on their parents as adults, and sometimes even depend on them to take care of their own children.
If anything, there is more evidence supporting the detrimental effects of rolling out a standardized curriculum to the people of this country. The continuous introduction of trendy and virtue-signalling curricula in the education system has failed to produce individuals capable of taking care of themselves after 12 years of schooling.
In all fairness this is a blatant lie from my side because there are other things that have grown more rapidly than that. This includes the amount of tax that has been gradually funnelled to the factory of failures that is the education department. With so much money to manage, of course politicians could justify bloated staff complements funded by the shrinking tax base. Even a communist minister faced severe criticism from his own constituents when he splurged on an extravagant car using taxpayers' money. It's rather ironic how those who advocate for communism tend to have an affinity for indulging in the fruits of capitalism.
13.3 Healthy nutrition and eating habits.
“Since 1994, the programme has tried to improve the ability of children to learn by combatting malnutrition, reducing hunger and improving school attendance. The programme is critical for furthering learners’ constitutional rights to basic nutrition (Section 28(1)(c) of the Constitution) and basic education (Section 29(1)(a) of the Constitution).” 
- Section27.org.za

The impact of nutrition on a child’s learning and development is well documented. It has been the impetus behind tax-payer funded school feeding schemes across the country. 
The adoption of the program by the government was not only an acknowledgement of the importance of good nutrition on children but also to tug the tax-payers to cough up more money. The program aimed to, or at least claimed as one of its objectives, that it was intended to provide nutritious meals to learners so as to improve their ability to learn. They also claimed the programme taught both students and parents good habits towards leading healthy lifestyles. 
While the actual intentions behind the rhetoric become evident when observing the flashy lifestyles of politicians and their cronies, what is important is the acknowledgement of a healthy diet as conducive, if not a prerequisite to learning.
In our country, child nutrition poses a significant challenge that impacts not only those who suffer from food insecurity but also those who have an excessive intake of food. The latter is more often a result of how easily it is to access processed foods that are high in sugar and salt to name a few. The food at the school canteen or spaza shop near the school is usually delicious but unhealthy for children. 
Even at best when my nephew took a lunchbox to school as was the norm, the food is often cold by the time he eats it, or not the same as the lunch he has when he is at home.
A study published in 2005 titled Food items consumed by students attending schools in different socioeconomic areas in Cape Town, South Africa found, amongst other things, that children who bought food from tuck shops at school were choosing twice as many unhealthy foods than the healthy. Very little had improved in terms of school tuck shops providing health options by 2021 as confirmed by The Food Environment of Primary School Learners in a Low-to-Middle-Income Area in Cape Town, South Africa study.
There is however no need to cite academic research because most of us have firsthand experience. I remember the grease dripping sugar laced treats my school mates enjoyed in primary while I was stuck with a lunchbox. The few occasions my parents would give me money for lunch I directly went for everything I wasn’t supposed to, predictably the sugary oily snacks! I still remember in high school; on Fridays it was an occasion to collect our money and go and buy some ‘yellow bread’. To date I cannot tell you what was in the bread but I remember it was sweet, even more so with other additional treats we’d get along with it.
None of these are a concern anymore with the children home. They get to eat the same food that is cooked for everyone, prepared with the same care and caution that a parent does. Not only have these efforts led to consistent health outcomes for the children, but they have also sparked a newfound enthusiasm for cooking their own meals, particularly the teenager. So, they can now complete the whole cycle, from planting the vegetables with their grandmother to harvest until the pot en route to the palate.
13.4. Flexible times preventing waking up too early
It is widely accepted as the norm for children to wake up at unreasonably early hours and spend excessive time in the classroom for school. However, research has shown that this is not beneficial for the developing child. Between 3 – 5 years old children require up to 13 hours of sleep. This drops to 9 – 12 for 6 – 12-year-olds and drops to 8 – 10 hours for teenagers.
Sleep is crucial for the body, especially in young children who are still growing. Adequate sleep can aid in the body’s recovery and ability to be resilient to certain medical conditions. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in an article titled How Sleep Works: Why is sleep important, problems such as Coronary heart disease, High blood pressure, and strokes are amongst the health conditions associated with lack of sleep.
Sleep deprivation has also been linked to obesity and memory problems. Not only is the problem because of increased consumption of bad food that is sweet, salty with the wrong fats but also interferes with the manner the body metabolises the food. The increase in obesity may also be due to the lack of physical activity as the person or child who isn’t getting enough sleep may feel tired and lethargic during the day when they are supposed to be alert and vital.
If lack of sleep has resulted in fatal mistakes for adults that have lost control while driving or operating dangerous equipment, can you imagine the long-term detrimental effects they might have on the child? Having worked in Risk Management specialising in Occupational Health and Safety I have witnessed and participated in a lot of incident investigations that were linked to lack of sleep-in industrial work environments. It is primarily one of the reasons why even Health and Safety and Labour legislation has requirements to ensure that people have adequate breaks and don’t work continuously on overtime.
Waking up too early also affects memory and learning. Considering the intention of sending children to school is for them to learn, it seems counterproductive to wake them up so early such that it negatively impacts their ability to learn. Medical Doctor Rachel Dawkins detailed the importance of sleep for kids in a similarly titled article “Studies have shown that kids who regularly get an adequate amount of sleep have improved attention, behaviour, learning, memory, and overall mental and physical health. Not getting enough sleep can lead to high blood pressure, obesity and even depression.”
Kevin C. Bastian and Sarah C. Fuller published Early Birds in Elementary School? School Start Times and Outcomes for Younger Students which looked at this subject.

For younger children it was found
“What evidence that does exist suggests that earlier start times are associated with a greater number of disciplinary incidents (Keller et al., 2017) and student absences (Heissel & Norris, 2018).”
“Likewise, earlier elementary school start times are associated with lower test proficiency rates (Keller et al., 2015) and reading achievement (Heissel & Norris, 2018). While suggestive, this previous research has limitations, including methods that may not isolate the impact of elementary school start times (Keller et al., 2015, 2017) and an assumption that daylight, rather than clock time, is a primary driver of sleep–wake cycles for elementary school students (Heissel & Norris, 2018).”
For adolescents
“Early school start times may make it challenging for adolescents to get the sleep they need, and consequently, fatigued students may be less engaged with and successful in school (Lu et al., 2011).”
“Regarding engagement with school, multiple studies show that students are absent less often and have higher grades when their high school starts later (Cortes et al., 2012; Dunster et al., 2018; Lenard et al., 2020; Wahlstrom, 2002; Wahlstrom et al., 2014). Likewise, statewide data from North Carolina show that students are less likely to be suspended when their high school starts later, with the largest reduction in the probability of being suspended for high schools starting at 8:30 a.m. or later (Bastian & Fuller, 2018).”
“Regarding student achievement, a random assignment study from the Air Force Academy shows that freshmen placed into early classes (starting before 8:00 a.m.) performed significantly worse on standardized course examinations. This negative effect held for first period and for subsequent periods throughout the day (Carrell et al., 2011). In the Florida panhandle, Heissel and Norris (2018) find that delaying start times 1 hour, relative to sunrise, increases test scores for high school students in math and reading.”
Homeschooling allows for flexible waking times that are more likely to benefit when children are most receptive to learning. This also means there is more time to spend with the family as everyone is not rushing very early in the morning to prepare while ignoring the quality time with the family in the process.
Homeschooling also benefits the parent’s sleep times. In the urban towns and cities of South Africa, one often has to get up far much earlier to arrive on time due to the traffic congestion. Solo’s mother for example has to leave the house by 6 am to make it in time to the office that is only 30 kilometres away.
The 30-minute drive to the office when there’s no traffic can easily be more than an hour during peak times in the morning. While this is bad it used to be worse when she was using public transport and often left the house by 5:30 am. Ultimately all this means she often left without even seeing Solo, something that didn’t get better when she came from work as this would be sometimes after 6 pm, further reducing the time she had for him.
13.5. Reduced travelling
“Africa has 2 percent of the world’s cars but 20 percent of the road deaths.”
Young Tae Kim, then the International Transport Forum (ITF) Secretary

In November 2022 in an article in the Financial Mail Editor-at-Large David Furlonger asked ‘Why SA has the world’s worst death rates?” The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) reported between January and March 2023 2498 lives were lost on South African roads.
That number is exceptionally high and shows the carnage we potentially expose ourselves to every time we venture out. Even worse is that a large number of people and children have no choice but to face this because workplaces and schools are often far from their places of residence. 
The reasons vary for this especially specific to schools, in rural areas for example some schools have had to be closed because there’s not enough people in that area anymore to justify the existence of a school since most rural dwellers are forced out of their homes to the urban areas due to lack of services and income generation opportunities.
In the past 3 years alone 350 public schools have been closed in rural areas and farmlands.  Elijah Mhlanga, The Department of Basic Education Spokesperson, confirmed “The main reason for closing schools is that those schools have been determined to be non-viable schools because the number of learners in those schools is small.” This means that the learners now have to go to a school that is much further, increasing their exposure to accidents. 
As most of these rural children walk to school it is worth noting that of the 2498 accidents the RTMC reported, the bulk of them at 30 percent involved pedestrians.
For those that leave the rural areas sometimes the problems are worse when they arrive in the urban areas as public schools, especially those close by, are often overcrowded or perceived to be of poor quality. This then necessitates school children taking scholar transport to and from school. A lot of parents often try to get the cheapest transport which, as can be expected, is run by drivers and owners who cut corners to maximise profits. 
In June this year social media was abuzz with an incident of a minibus taxi that was transporting 48 school children. For reference, taxi capacity is around 14 seats. You would think this was a record or an isolated incident, not so. In 2020 eNCA reported on a minibus taxi that had 58 children! In 2019 TimesLive showed a Taxi with 48 children. 
The risks don’t end there, as sometimes the vehicles the children are being transported on are not even roadworthy. Cape Town has been on a drive to impound unroadworthy vehicles and in what the article described as a crisis scholar transport vehicles were frequently impounded. The Randfontein Herald published in November 2022 “Over 60 unroadworthy scholar transport vehicles discontinued”
It is not uncommon when driving anywhere that’s populated to find children hiking as they walk home hoping someone will offer them a free ride. This not only exposes them to the risk of being hit by a car but also human trafficking and kidnaping. These incidents have been on the rise in the country as the rest of the crime statistics have shot up.
These are just a few examples of the risks that come with increased travelling to, and from school. Sometimes the drivers are simply negligent or in a rush to get to their next destinations such that they leave the children behind.
There are very few things as unsettling for a parent as realising that their child has not arrived from school as per schedule. This gets even worse when a frantic call to the driver of the scholar transport is responded to by someone who couldn't care less. This happened with my nephew, the most annoying part was the response from the driver “I don’t know where he is, he was not where he should be when I went to pick him up”. Then why didn’t you call me to notify me of the problem? “I didn’t think of it”.
Then there's waking up at ungodly hours because of the traffic. I feel so guilty every time I have to wake my son at dawn. The fact that the school is only 10 kilometres away is immaterial. Between the other kids the driver of the scholar transport has to collect and the traffic in Johannesburg which is exacerbated by loadshedding road infrastructure that is in bad condition, the school might as well be in another metro!
I can go on and mention the road accidents that seem to be on the rise making one wonder if each time they leave the house if they’ll come back.
Thankfully I don’t have to worry as much about most of these things as having a home as the school eliminates, or at least drastically reduces most of these risks. In cases where the children must go for activities and such the driver is us, or at least a parent who has as much to lose should they be negligent, compared to a driver who has no child in the car she is driving! 

Part 5: Informal Knowledge, Unarticulated Wisdom   and Family Diversity
14. The danger of equating formal schooling with teaching and qualifications for knowledge
 “To say that a farm boy knows how to milk a cow is to say that we can send him out to the barn with an empty pail and expect him to return with milk. 
To say that a criminologist understands crime is not to say that we can send him out with a grant or a law and expect him to return with a lower crime rate. He is more likely to return with a report on why he has not succeeded yet, and including the inevitable need for more money, a larger staff, more sweeping powers, etc. 
In short, the degree of authentication of knowledge may be lower in the "higher" intellectual levels and much higher in those areas which intellectuals choose to regard as "lower."”
Thomas Sowell

Between my parents, my father was the most educated. He successfully completed his matric and obtained a highly valuable certificate that greatly helped him find employment in rural Transkei, avoiding the need to travel to the mines like many other men had to do.
My mother didn’t finish high school. She doesn’t have a qualification that was conferred to her by an external authority she can claim to her name. If having a qualification is certification of being educated, by this standard my mother is uneducated.
Before I lost my way and deviated from the norm by opting to pursue knowledge instead of credentials, I was 3 credits shy of completing my LLB degree with UNISA. Despite my decision to drop out of law school, it remains undeniable that I am the most accomplished individual in my family, surpassing both my father and my youngest sisters in terms of academic credentials. Between a National Diploma and a Bachelor of Technology, I completed numerous credentialed specialized courses over the years.
In line with this line of thinking that interpreted qualifications and prioritized formal articulated knowledge over informal unarticulated knowledge and experience, I believed as a prerequisite to having a child I must be able to afford the best. I worked tirelessly to achieve the career status that provided me with the financial resources I 'lacked' during my upbringing. Moreover, it provided me with access to a diverse array of professionals and experts who could support me in availing the 'best' conditions for my child's growth and development. 


14.1. Unarticulated knowledge and uncredentialed expertise
Convention perpetuated the belief that my mother's lack of formal qualifications would prevent her from effectively contributing to her grandchild's health and well-being. The only role she would play is to be that of the loving grandmother who enthrals the children with tales from times gone by.
Both my parents lost their mothers around the same age I was when my father died. By the time I was born my grandfathers had long remarried. During my childhood, I always had the privilege of being treated kindly by my step-grandmothers whenever I visited them. Still, I felt that I might have missed the experience of having a biological grandmother.
My mother's stepmother played a crucial role in my life. Without her, I may not have made it through birth. Similarly, from my father's side, I never felt I didn't belong as a grandchild when I visited.
Despite everything, I made a firm decision at a young age to create an environment where my children can truly benefit from their grandmothers' presence to the fullest extent possible. My mother would always be close by, but I had no expectations of her playing any functional role, she was, after all, uneducated.
I didn't realize that her highest qualification was right in front of me every time I looked in the mirror. Any suspicions of her declining ability to raise children as she gets older have been completely shattered by the fact that all my nephews and niece were born while under my mother's care and are currently thriving, without any problems.
When Sazi was born, Solo was almost 8, while Milande was almost one. Solo grew up with my mother in the Eastern Cape, in the same rural village where I and my siblings grew up. Despite the 'substandard' conditions that failed to meet external expectations, she managed to accomplish the task for Solo just as she had been doing since 1982. 
None of this was obvious to me. I was, after all, educated and had attained the material success to give my child ‘the best’ I could afford. I owned 3 rental properties and my primary residence. I also had 3 vehicles and other assets that I acquired through my job and business. I worked tirelessly to maintain them. 
Experts and authority figures based the standard for 'best', of course, on articulation, credentials and endorsements.
14.2. Articulated knowledge and credentialed expertise.
After my son was born, he stayed with his mother and maternal grandmother, the latter being the primary caregiver. She is a retired health professional who worked locally and internationally during her career. With multiple qualifications, including a Master’s Degree, if it was qualifications I was looking for in a primary caregiver, my son was off to a great start.
In the first 3 years of life, Sazi had access to various medical specialists through his mother. These specialists included a Paediatrician, Orthopaedic surgeon, Nephrologist, and Urologist, as referred by the paediatrician. My son's medical aid card was kept by his mother to make sure that he would receive the best healthcare for any health issues she had concerns about.
Unlike his cousins, Sazi has always had specialized care by nannies his mother deemed competent for the job. By the time he was 3, at least as many nannies had looked after him, a trend that continued with at least a new nanny each year.
All the other children get milk from their mothers when they are babies. As they grow up, they eat the same food as everyone else in the house, starting from soft porridge and such. They have all grown up using regular baby products without the need for specialized or premium formula or high-end diapers and skincare products. 
Such was not good enough for my son.
When he was finally granted permission to visit his paternal home in April 2019, he arrived fully equipped with his own prepared meals, a clear set of dietary instructions, and even a dedicated nanny to care for him during his half-day sessions. The day this was deviated from by his uneducated aunts and grandmother almost resulted in all future visiting privileges terminated.
He was never to stray from his specified regimen of sugar-free plain yogurt, 3 to 4 servings of grapes, or an equivalent amount of another fruit, and low-calorie rice cakes. Among some of the noteworthy specialised/ premium items in his diet and monthly essentials his mother specified included:
S26 gold milk formula,
Novalac premium
Pampers premium,
Afrobotanics skincare and hair products.
Dove soap products,
So Pure laundry detergent
So how did having ‘the best’ workout for Buggz? Did his better material advantage reflect in his health, wellbeing, and development outcomes when compared to his cousins?
In the first year he spent 5 weeks in hospital, and would continue to spend some time in a year hospitalized until he was 3. Between his mother and paediatrician, every specialist imaginable was recommended. 
When he delayed speaking, he was advised to see a speech therapist. This was surprising because he didn't have any other issues in his physical development, quite the opposite. When Buggz was 3, he surprised everyone by reading simple words like traffic signs and logos without being taught.
Contrast this to his cousins, who’s primary caregivers have zero qualifications and have no experience that is externally endorsed.
Sazi has seen more doctors and specialists than all the other children combined.
The last time Solo, Milande, Mila and Azora slept in the hospital was the day they were born.
None of the males in my family, including me, Solo, and Milande, have ever required speech therapy, even though we all started talking late.
By the time he was 5 at least 5 nannies had cared for Sazi in this maternal home, 5 being a conservative estimate. There is no other child in my family that has been raised by a single nanny, let alone 5.
In his first 3 years of life, Sazi was not only the sickest but also the moodiest child. This happened more often with him than it did to all the other children, combined! 


14.3. The value of personal experience over credentialed expertise
Nothing humbled me more than the real-life experience that made me realize my mistaken belief that formal education and credentials equate to being educated. I spent more money on Sazi during his first 3 years of life compared to what has been spent on other children for the same period, but he has had the worst outcomes so far. 
When Sazi began to spend more time with his paternal grandmother, aunts, and cousins, his health and well-being improved significantly. Since his first sleepover in June 2021, the number of doctor and hospital visits has decreased as the sleepovers increased to 3 nights.
The last time he slept in a hospital was in 2020.
In 2021, the number of times he visited a doctor dropped by more than 50 percent from the preceding years.
The amount of antibiotics he has used since 2021 are a fraction of what he had been prescribed before.
He eats the same food as everyone else in the house and has similar results to the other children. He is a healthy weight, possibly the best appetite of all children except the teenager, and is developing predictably. He is now a little taller than Milande, suggesting that he may have inherited his maternal grandfather's height.
While the first time he laughed was a shock especially to Kwakho because it was such a rare occurrence, he is now as loud and laughing as often as the rest of the children. 
When my son is sick, as is the case with all children in the family, there is no one I trust more than my mother.
For some time, Sazi had an allergy that necessitated he be medicated. Despite multiple visits to multiple doctors, specialized and general, none solved the problem. Spending time with his uneducated grandmother proved to be more effective than the expensive interventions provided by highly educated specialists. My mother went to the garden, found a plant and applied it to her grandchild. Since then, he is no longer on medication and the rash is a thing of the past.
Before he was born, I laughed at the idea of confirming paternity by seeing if he had inherited my mother's nosebleeds, like all of her descendants. Although I was eager to find out and chose the faster option of DNA testing, my son had a nosebleed one day. Every now and then, like it happens to everyone in the family to varying extents, he experiences a few drops of blood appearing from his nose.
His grandmother reminded me that he was delaying speaking, just like me, Solo, and Milande. My sister, who is 3 years my junior, was quicker to speak and could express herself better than I did as a child. Most people still remember her as the young girl who would spell her name when you asked her even before starting school, “My name is V-I-S-A M-D-E-N-I, Visa Mdeni” was her line. My youngest sisters were able to express themselves vocally at a much earlier age than I did, continuing the trend. 
I, however, was the introverted child who valued solitude over socializing, often making an effort to avoid large groups of people. Despite my delayed speech as a child, I have had a profound impact on improving the quality of life for my sisters and their children.
Outside my mother, Dr Sowell's own experiences as published in Late-Talking Children was an eye-opener. Sazi's ability to read without having been taught reflected a consistent pattern that aligned with the late-talking children identified by Dr Sowell, including his own child.
Sowell's research on Late-Talking Children and other insightful publications exudes an undeniable aura of credibility and relatability. Even more impressive is that he later tells us about his son, who has proven to be exceptionally intelligent with remarkable achievements in life. It is just as comparable to my own experiences.
I was often the best student in my class throughout my schooling and I have had many important roles in my career. But all of that was just a means to an end, not an end by itself. Any educational achievement or career success I’ve had would have been empty, if they couldn’t benefit my family. In my personal journey, true intelligence is not gauged by prestigious positions, exorbitant incomes, or luxurious automobiles. Rather, it is determined by my ability to aptly provide for the well-being of both myself and my loved ones.
I’ve been able to provide for myself since I was 18, alleviating the pressure to provide for me on my mother. Between the merit bursaries, student loan from National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) of which a substantial proportion was converted to a bursary due to my results and contracts I entered into with family and friends, I was able to provide for myself with minimal assistance from my mother.
My mother hasn’t had the pressure to provide since I was 20 years old, when I finished my National Diploma and started working. 
My sisters have never had to do extreme things to support themselves, even though two of them have never had a stable job outside the home. Both of them went to private school, have a grade 12 certificate and tertiary certificates as well.
Everything within my family that I succeeded my father on when he died has improved, including;
Moving, not just myself but my whole family from our parental home in rural villages that fall under the traditional property system which denies owners tenure security.
My mother's life has continuously improved, and much of that improvement has been because of me. She lives a life of being valued surrounded by all her children and grandchildren most of the time
All of my parent’s descendants have a good quality of life with access to the people that care for them most. Even if one of the children's parents were to die, most of the people who care about them will still be here. 


14.4. Physician, heal thyself
“And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.’”
Luke 4:23 KJV

Credentialed health professionals treat many people, but nothing can replace the experience of a parent raising children and grandchildren. When an issue arises in the short term for an individual who has received advice or treatment from a specialist, the specialist has significantly less at stake in comparison to the individual and their loved ones. 
For each visit my son made to his paediatrician, who was all too happy to recommend another one of her colleagues and so on, they all got paid. Their payment was not dependent on their treatment or advice being correct, let alone being sustainable in the long term.
The negative impacts of these consequences, which can be very serious for individuals and families, may not have a significant long-term effect on a professional's career, allowing them to still be considered the top choice. If his colleagues have experienced more fatalities under similar circumstances, the candidate who had a single botched operation resulting in the death of a family's sole breadwinner would be the most suitable choice for the top position. 
Even after the professional has moved on to a more successful position, their victims will still have to endure the ongoing consequences: an unwarranted lingering pain, a scar much larger than necessary, unfulfilled career potential due to negligence, and much more.
This is no different from the politicians and bureaucrats who claim to care and have an interest in delivering a good service that resolves people’s problems. There is no greater evidence of the triumph of the education system’s success in dumbing people down than the belief that an entity whose very same existence was justified by the existence of the problem, will ever have an interest in reducing said problem, let alone resolve it. 
My mother, on the other hand, invests her life in us because should anything go wrong, she will lose personally. My family’s survival literally hinged on my success after my father died. If something happened to me, the threat would also affect all her descendants. Unlike me, who have been successful in providing for all of them from the start, neither she nor my sisters have shown that they can do the same, even when working together.
To an external surrogate, a misdiagnosis, botched operation or single death is a statistic. The cost of ineffective treatments is not the main concern. Failed surgery can have life-changing consequences. Losing a child can be devastating for a parent. It could mean losing their only child and any grandchildren and someone to care for them in their old age. My mother's dedication to her family has been the greatest investment she has ever made, bringing back rewards that surpass any other and fulfilling her in ways no other investment could.
My partner has been living with the consequences of a negligent professional for almost half her life. The necessary post-appendectomy routine procedures were neglected, leading to unbearable pain and life-altering consequences for the then young girl. Although you may assume that the procedure was conducted in a government facility, it actually took place in one of East London's top-rated hospitals that supposedly has top rated professionals and practices.
There is nothing that taught me the dangers of trusting articulated knowledge and formal education than my own lived experience. The only value of a tertiary qualification is to serve as prima facie evidence of competence, once one’s experience has been established it shouldn’t matter what a certificate says. There is no greater evidence of competence and expertise than when one has a personal stake, whether directly or through their kin. 
There is no better indication of the competency of external surrogates than observing government employees using the services they provide to the majority of the population for their own families. This seldom happens, if ever. Government health professionals, both current and past, choose private healthcare over the services provided by their colleagues. Teachers send their children to private schools to avoid the negative impact of being taught by their colleagues. Politicians, bureaucrats, and other government employees consistently choose private service providers for their own children and families.
The behaviour of individuals who possess a financial interest in services funded by taxes serves as undeniable evidence of the lack of credibility of credentials of most public servants, and the insignificance of their expertise when it is most crucial. On a personal level they know to never trust their colleagues because they have first-hand experience of their competence. These are the same people we are supposed to trust, despite themselves not even trusting each other.
Thomas Sowell’s writing helped me make sense of what was right before my eyes. The thing that troubles me the most is how everything that went against what I learned from my parents and family shaped my life.
The continuous repetition of these lies during my formal education almost overshadowed what was undeniably true in my own life.
“Some things are believed because they are demonstrably true, but many other things are believed simply because they have been asserted repeatedly and repetition has been accepted as a substitute for evidence.” 
Thomas Sowell




15. Homeschooling complements our diverse family structures.
“ONCE UPON A TIME,
 a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.  Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long, so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire.  It was she who cooked the meals. It was she who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.”
Cinderella Fairy Tale Illustrated By: Suzie Chang from Bedtime Stories for Kids 

There are clear signs that conservative South Africans are increasingly embracing the idea that the nuclear family is the most beneficial structure for raising children. If this truth holds now, it is assumed that it has always been so.
The irony is that until recently extended families were the norm rather than the exception. Today, many people who first chose the nuclear family are going back to live with their extended family, despite the current trends. The nuclear family's origin story is questionable, especially for those who live or have ancestors from rural areas.


15.1. The nuclear family’s sketchy South African origin story.
During my early years, it was a common custom for young men to say goodbye to their families in the rural region of Transkei and set off on a trip to search for meaningful work. The young man was expected to send money when he got paid, even if it meant sacrificing his own comfort to send more money home. It was not uncommon to find a man living in squalor with little regard for his own comfort. 
Living quarters were cramped and often unhygienic, lacking any services except for providing shelter from the elements. It was considered essential rather than a concern, since anything more would have necessitated extra funds specifically designated for the family back home. The allure of becoming overly comfortable and losing sight of the original purpose for venturing into the mines became overwhelmingly tangible . When the dwelling was equipped with all the necessary amenities, so went the logic.
Indeed, these arrangements worked out well for most; I am a descendant of such. Both my grandfathers, at some point, undertook the voyage in search of better financial opportunities. They also stayed in less-than-ideal conditions. Thanks to their sacrifice and planning, they were able to send enough money back home to support their families and raise children who are now grandparents.
Men who chose this approach of humble living at work often maintained high status in their communities. They were respected for their hard work, which helped them support their families, build homes, and gain material wealth like livestock and other assets. Again, my grandfathers were no different.
Their story is one with a positive outcome, like so many. Unfortunately, not everyone who left their wife and children with extended family to support was as committed. In fact, some of them didn't even bother to go back. The father would often meet another woman in the mines or factories and start a new family.
My mother often tells captivating stories about the strong-willed women from the former Transkei who would boldly surprise their husbands with unexpected visits, driven by the fear of being replaced. Customary wives often found out too late, after their husband died, that their traditional marriage was no longer recognized.
The realization was disheartening because their spouse chose to marry another woman in a civil ceremony. He chose to start a nuclear family with her, leaving behind his children and wife with their extended family.
Numerous incidents revealed the inevitable outcome of children being sent to their grandparents and aunts in the Transkei when nuclear families broke down. After the death of their spouse, some wives in this union would often feel overwhelmed and seek support from their extended family members.
When a couple moves from rural to urban areas to start a new life, they often leave their children with extended family members until they have found their footing. In cases of marital problems within the urban nuclear family, it is quite common for the couple to temporarily entrust their children to their relatives while they work on resolving and finding solutions for their issues.
This helps parents establish a stable life for the family. Whenever things go wrong with one or both parents in a nuclear family, it is always the extended family that steps in, whether they want to or not. The extended family holds immense value, to the point that even the Constitution recognizes this and government officials prioritize finding relatives for orphaned children over sending them to state facilities.


15.2. The triumph of the extended family
Most of our ancestors reared their children in extended family settings. In 2023, the case against the nuclear family being better than the extended family is even stronger, with the country's poor economic conditions further highlighting the evidence. Many people who valued independence before chose to move back home to make the most of the limited resources in our struggling economy.
The Family Laws South Africa website presents a compelling graphic that initially appears to convey positive news, showing a decrease in the number of divorces in 2020. However, upon closer examination, a deeper and more significant story is revealed. Although there was a noticeable decrease in divorces in 2020, with even the subsequent increase in the following year remaining lower than pre-2020 levels, it is worth noting that the number of marriages has also been declining for several years.
The drop is such that 2012 marriage numbers are higher by over 50 thousand compared to 2021 according to Statistics South Africa. There might not be a clear connection between the decline in nuclear families, the decline in marriage rates, and the rise in divorce rates. This is because couples can choose to stay together without marrying.
Although it is possible and some people have managed to maintain relationships without getting married, these cases are rare. The binding nature of a marriage contract prevents spouses from acting impulsively even during times of temptation or weakness.
Given the high rate of people walking out of marriages, as evidenced by the statistics, it begs the question: how much more easily can they be swayed to stay without a legally binding contract?
At best, the nuclear family is a compromise.
Over 20 percent of children aged 17 and younger in South Africa live with grandparents or other relatives. In 2019 the proportion of households classified as nuclear families was more than those classified as extended families.
In the past and even now, the extended family remains the common choice for raising multiple children. 
While this may be because having more family members in a household result in a higher number of children, having more children per person, or any children at all for that matter, may be possible due to effective cost containment and reduced dependence on expensive and often ineffective ‘professionals’ and ‘experts’ in an extended family. 
15.3. The extended family, one of the time-tested solutions to the female headed home crisis.
“Globally, Female Headed Household (FHH (no male)) tended to be poorer than the other two categories: overall, the poorest quintile represented 23.8 percent of FHH (no male), 16.7 percent of FHH (any male) and 20.0 percent of Male Headed Household (MHH). 
South Asia was the region with lowest proportion of FHH (no male) in the wealthiest quintile (12.8 percent). FHH (any male) were generally wealthier than FHH (no male) in all regions. Compared to MHH, FHH (any male) also tended to be slightly wealthier in most regions except for Eastern & Southern Africa and Middle East & North Africa were the distribution of quintiles for FHH (any male) and MHH were very similar.”
Andrea Wendt a,*, Franciele Hellwig a, Ghada E. Saad b, Cheikh Faye c, Zitha Mokomane d, Ties Boerma e, Aluisio J.D. Barros f, Cesar Victora - Are children in female-headed households at a disadvantage? An analysis of immunization coverage and stunting prevalence: in 95 low- and middle-income countries 

A child who is not born into an extended, or at least a nuclear family is likely to face disadvantages, especially if they are raised in a household led by a woman, in the absence of an adult male.
Female Headed Households (FHH), both in South Africa and globally, have shown to put children at a disadvantage from the start according to an article titled Poverty may have declined, but women and female-headed households still suffer most, published by Michael Rogan. It was expected that things would change, especially considering the discriminatory laws that have taken money mainly earned by men since 1994 and used it only to support women and girls, with men and boys explicitly excluded.
The impact of having a male in the home is so profound that even female headed households with an adult male fare better than those with no male. Nowhere is this evident than in my own personal life. 
There are glaring differences in the lives of my mother, her sisters, and sisters-in-law. The main factor that sets them apart is often the presence of a male in their lives. Married women enjoy significantly more stable households, even in the face of their spouses' passing, just like my mother's case. By the time I was 18 years old I was no longer part of my mother’s obligations which provided more resources for her and my sisters. Though they, my mother and 2 youngest sisters never held formal employment that provided sufficient income for their individual livelihoods, their lives have continued to improve since my 18th birthday. 
In the absence of a child's father, the extended family usually has a male figure to serve as an authentic father figure. I have never found any fault in this, which is why Solo, at the age of 13, knows that if anything were to happen to me, he has a duty to succeed me, for as long as needed, until Sazi is ready. 
My mother barely survived the pressure to provide after my father's death. I believe that as long as there are supportive men in the lives of the women I value, there is hope. Which is why I invest so much in my son and my nephews.
Similarly, when the mother does not live with the child, the child can still receive important feminine support from aunts, grandmothers, and other female family members in an extended family arrangement.
Children benefit more from being in an extended family setting than in a nuclear family or single-parent household, even if their parents are separated or in new relationships.
Academic research consistently demonstrates that children, even those who are adopted and raised apart from their biological relatives, still share many similarities with their kin. Discovering our identity is a profound journey that often begins within our biological family. Our essence is not only shaped by our parents but also by the crucial influence of our extended family members. Their unique significance offers us a glimpse into how certain genetic features may manifest in us. A significant portion of this knowledge is acquired not only through explicit lessons passed down by our family members, but also through unconscious inference.
If my son had never met me or any of my family members, he would be surprised by many things, some of which could potentially shock him. Even if I had died before he was born, knowing that his paternal grandmother bestowed nosebleeds upon all her children and grandchildren, his first encounter with this would not be as shocking.
In my absence, as long as he had witnessed one of his cousins going through the experience his anxiety will be significantly reduced when it happens to him. That would also bring relief to his mother and caregiver if they understand the context. 
Despite his delayed speech, I was able to confidently dismiss the modern-day snake oil salesmen that suggested this is a problem to be solved by them and their peers, at a premium to me.
Throughout history, there have been numerous examples of compassionate stepparents who wholeheartedly loved and cared for their stepchildren, showing them the same level of affection and attention as their own biological children. This devotion did not waver even after their partner's passing. However, we cannot ignore the many cases where stepchildren have been treated significantly worse than others.
When this occurs away from the child's blood relatives, it can continue without stopping and lead to tragic consequences. Sometimes, parents unintentionally behave this way because they feel frustrated and overwhelmed by the responsibility of doing everything alone that used to be shared by two people.
In recent years, my mother has felt the need to apologize for how strict she was after my father died. While she might think so, in retrospect, she was no different from when my father was alive, quite the opposite. 
I was so used to the routines that even when I left home to stay in Mpumalanga, I didn’t change. Observing her authentic behaviour made me truly grasp the profound manner in which I embody that very essence. 
I fail to perceive the purpose behind offering an apology. It would have been acting otherwise to her nature, in line with some trend, that would have had deleterious effects. 
I am deeply appreciative of the resilience she demonstrated in the face of overwhelming obstacles, rather than dwelling on a mistake she has convinced herself she made due to a passing psychological trend.
The extended family environment serves as a very effective control in at least reducing the probability of this happening. Even in the darkest periods of our lives, often it is the familiar that helps us through. Widowed parents in extended families can receive support from relatives and kin to ease their burden.
Knowing that neglecting a stepchild will be noticed by the child's grandparents, uncles, aunts, and others in the extended family can reduce the temptation to do so.
Even in the most disturbing scenario, when a child is subjected to severe mistreatment and feels compelled to escape, they can always seek refuge within an extended family setting. This is wholly different from the child whose parents relocated to an area far from their supportive extended family. Apart from family friends, who may not be as patient as relatives, the child's next option is government service, which can often be even worse than being raised in a female-headed household.


15.4. The nuclear and female-headed household model reliance on external surrogates
“If you stick with the issue to the bitter end, you will find that Newsweek reported the new evidence that infants in daycare for twenty or more hours a week are at risk and that the high turnover rate among paid caregivers and the high disease rate of institutionalized children make daycare a very uncertain and unhappy place for children.
Back on page ninety-two, Newsweek ruefully admits: "Despite the compelling evidence about the dark side of daycare, many experts say there's a great reluctance to discuss these problems publicly." 
Why? "Because they're afraid the right wing will use this to say that only mothers can care for babies, so women should stay home.”
What the liberals and the feminists are really afraid of is not the right wing but the eternal truth that the traditional family is still the best way to live, and that babies still need mothers in the home.”
Phyllis Stewart Schlafly, Reinventing the Family, 1989

The nuclear family setup relies on outside experts and surrogates to fulfil roles that are traditionally carried out by relatives in an extended family. I see this as one of its major downsides.
In many situations, both parents work in these settings. As a result, children need to be cared for and educated most of the day by people who are not family members. I have firsthand experience with the dangers of relying too heavily on specialists, experts, and other external parties who have no personal stakes in the long-term child's well-being.
These are not new occurrences, which is why the extended family has thrived throughout human history and still does, despite the presence of more trendy alternatives.
As far back as 1989 conservatives have been sounding the alarm against reliance on external surrogates, especially for raising children. One of the few women who truly deserved the title of Mrs. America warned us early on about the dangers of this approach. 
Since time immemorial there has been no one more suited to care for children than their family. There is no threat that prioritising women will regress the career progression of the empowered woman because she can wholeheartedly embrace her career with the children at home cared for by the father and the extended family.

15.5. Homeschooling is flexible as families are diverse.
Given the increasing reality that a child’s parents are likely to be apart rather than together, it is even more important to find ways to minimize the negative impact of these circumstances on the child’s relationship with either of their parents and extended family.
Due to the high prevalence of divorces, declining marriage rates, and the choice of individuals to have children without being in a relationship, it is becoming more likely that more and more children will be born into these circumstances.
When my parents met, their roles in the relationship were clear, and there was no ambiguity about who had to do what. "It made sense that my mother would stay behind and build a home while my father went outside to work and provide for the family. Neither of them could have accomplished as much alone as they did together, because each had important skills and qualities for raising children that the other lacked.
The situation when my son's parents first met was thoroughly distinct. We both already had a strong sense of independence. She was a proud homeowner, while I owned not only my primary residence but also two rental properties. Cooking and cleaning in my home were tasks I did well since I was a teenager, leaving no need for her help in those areas. Moreover, she had the financial means to sustain herself without my assistance.
Other than our complementary sex specific characteristics, we had no practical utility for each other. The dependence that forced my parents to work together because neither would have had a home without the other was not there. Our only reliance, romantic love, was our glue.  
For all the admiration, romantic love has a poor record as a sufficient reason to sustain a relationship. We were no different.
When Sazi was conceived I had already terminated our relationship with his mother, somehow romantic emotions were still working hard, however in vain to keep us together. If it wasn’t for her moving into one of the cottages in my home while she was moving out, my son would have never been conceived. We barely stayed together long enough to have him, but that didn’t take away from our ability to have him. Even long after we established, we were horrible to each other as partners. Our ability to have a great child prevailed so much that when she wanted another child, she still came to me, a request I could not accept.
Enrolling a child in a fixed school can limit the time that they can spend with the other parent, which is problematic considering how crucial the family is in any child's meaningful education. The traditional fixed school model is not ideal for children to have access to their parents and families. This is especially true when parents are not together.
A remote learning solution offers a vastly improved option for families in such situations. Irrespective of where the child is, as long as they have their study material, they have access to their school.
Homeschooling, with its flexibility, is the ultimate solution. Flexibility allows the child to fully engage in both family activities without being distracted by rigid schedules and inflexible curricula. While staying at the maternal home, if there is an aunt who possesses a captivating skill, the child can have the opportunity to learn from her in more ways than one. Not only can the child gain knowledge from what is consciously taught, but they can also grasp the nuances that are beyond words.
There is nothing so bad, no good can come of it, and even the poor unemployment rate in the country can be an advantage in relation to homeschooling. The decades of taxpayer-derived funds being directed to programs meant to advance girls and women may have yielded little results beyond the superficial, but they have contributed immensely to a significant percentage of men opting out of formal institutions that explicitly exclude them or at least lower their value on the bases of sex, leading them towards informal employment.
Sometimes, men now have a better chance than women to be at home and spend time with their children because they have more flexibility in their schedules. Today, empowered feminist women are finally liberated to pursue careers they were once unjustly prevented from due to the oppressive forces of patriarchy. This does not mean that the child has to be raised by strangers in the absence of a parent, as even when caregivers are needed, at least the father will be there for supervision.
Traditionally, men have been revered for their role as providers but seldom acknowledged for their ability to rise up to the occasion, when the situation demanded they do both. It also didn't help that unlike before, the father's relevance as a provider even lost its value as the empowered woman could provide for herself.
The evolution of the father being a respected figure degenerated over the years as can be seen in popular television shows of the 80s and 90s. However, there are people who have been raised by their fathers as primary caretakers. In recent decades, women have made significant progress in their careers with the help of government-funded programs. In the same way, fathers are also capable of rising to the occasion when needed.
The vast majority of these men have accomplished this feat entirely on their own, without any reliance on taxpayer-funded programs or the shelter of government protection. More often than not they have done this despite the government, rarely if ever because of. 
While the idea of a superwoman who effortlessly manages the responsibilities of being a flawless mother, excels in both parental roles, and succeeds in her career has enamoured countless people, the truth is that these exceptional individuals are more mythical than real. Therefore, by empowering fathers to care for the children, mothers can reclaim precious time to wholeheartedly pursue their professional ambitions. 
Everyone on Earth, even superwoman, faces the same limitation. There are only so many hours in a day, and we all have a finite lifespan. This constraint has no exceptions, so far at least, unless we venture into the realm of imagination.
I've witnessed fathers who have astonishingly embraced the challenging circumstances of 2020 and excelled at being present at home, devoting more quality time to their children. Of all the people, very few inspired me as much as SN who thrived after getting an opportunity to spend more time at home as a self-employed business owner. I had never felt more motivated to spend more time at home educating my kids than when I was with him, XM, or heard the fulfillment from MK, CR, ™, to mention a few.
It came as no surprise when I was presented with an opportunity to take a year off and formal employment at age 20, I eagerly seized it, cherishing the privilege that my father and grandfather could only have imagined in our family lineage. Through my personal experience, I have come to realize the shallowness, if not total fiction of this apparent conflict, suggesting that men hinder women from pursuing formal employment.
Nothing in my life has brought me more fulfillment than my family. Every chance I get to spend time with them is something I have worked tirelessly for. Throughout my successful career, I have always regarded my employment as a stepping stone towards the ultimate goal: ensuring the welfare of my cherished family members. Compared to the tiniest accomplishments within my family, all of my career achievements are insignificant.
Men often give in to their wives' fashionable whims, which can have disastrous consequences in the long run, due to their commitment to the nuclear family. Many times, in an effort to maintain harmony and preserve the superficial unity of the family, people choose to overlook evidence and prioritize solutions that protect the emotional well-being of the other party.
The father's role is not only to protect but also to prepare the child for life's challenges. However, the mother's tendency to see their children as babies and emphasise the protection over preparing often overshadows this role. 
Although I have a strong aversion to sports and physical activity being mandated on all school children, by no means do I think it doesn’t have a crucial place in our lives, especially as a man. In fact, even in my life there is a time when my best outlet was lifting weights. 
Sports can be risky, especially contact sports. In fact, for most adrenaline junkies’ sports is thrilling because it is risky, if it was any less it would be ineffective as an outlet. For many men, sports have provided an outlet that has saved their lives. This outlet can come from making a career in sports or simply having a punching bag to release anger. 
School sport has now been toned down so much in a quest to make it safe, which no longer serves the purpose with boys and men suffering as a consequence. In some places it is even viewed as vulgar to encourage competition and keeping scores. The motherly instinct to protect their baby has been satisfied, because the father kept quiet to protect his wife's emotions.
It is only within the framework of the nuclear family that a woman possesses this overwhelming power, unless she is empowered by the government, as is currently the case. We are bearing the burden of men who are excessively feminized and disapprove of taking responsibility, viewing Karl Marx as a role model. They say silence is golden, but sometimes the things left unsaid can become a heavy burden, and harm to the whole family later in life.
There is no such in an extended family, bar to negative government interference. Parents tend to be more honest and hold each other to account by a higher standard, because there are no feelings to nurse.
My son's mother knows her important role in my life as the woman who gave birth to our son, who I consider to be the best part of myself. However, respecting her doesn't mean we should ignore the facts just to spare her feelings. She also has a similar obligation of honesty and holding me accountable irrespective of how much it hurts my ego. I don't have to worry about keeping my nuclear family intact because I don't have one to begin with.
One of my mother’s greatest virtues is her brutal honesty. This was seldom tailored to my feelings, but its educational value was immense. I was always aware of my reality and hence could plan accordingly. I never pretended to have more than I do, then and now. I don't wear name brands or aspire to own a German car, then, and now. 
My reality, shaped by my mother's honesty, made me aware of this.
The year before I went to standard 10 (matric/ grade 12), she took me to Old Mutual to go over the education policy that my father had obtained for our family. It consisted of approximately fourteen thousand for me and my sisters; it could have been worse, there could have been nothing. 
When I began searching for a career, I was well aware of how much money I had and studied very hard because both mine and my family's lives depended on it.
Had I failed even a year at school and started working later than I did, I doubt my mother could have maintained the family that far, performing my father’s roles in addition to hers. But not for honesty, my family’s reality would be vastly different today, and not in a good way.
It is important for me to hold my son's mother accountable and be honest. It is part of my parental obligations. One of the things I truly admire about Buggz's mother is her valuable experience as an only child, which resonates with me since Buggz is also an only child, so far at least. 
It is essential for me to ensure that I offer the utmost care to her child, as he will become her only connection to kinship and family one day, until she has another child at least. I feel a great responsibility to ensure that my son fully takes advantage of the privileges he has to draw from real-life experiences, that only happens if I am honest with him and his mother.
I put a lot of effort into finding a suitable person to be the mother of my child. But I never expected to be so compatible and comparable to his mother that it would be this relevant to Buggz.
She is my complete opposite. We can easily see how our actions today will affect our child's future just by reflecting on our experiences. I aspired to a certain kind of life for my child, being told that it was ideal. I don't need to guess to understand the long-term consequences of growing up in a home with abundant material resources compared to prioritizing other things. Before doing anything, I always consult our experience. 
Her experience, being the most consistent with her son's, is often my guide, either to follow or as a cautionary tale.
When the time comes and my son reaches the age, I will also be honest with him. 
Whenever Buggz is at a crossroads, he will always have the benefit of knowing what either of his parents did when faced with the same problem, and how it worked out, so far at least.
Sometimes none of this is emotionally pleasing. There's no need for either of us to worry about our emotions, as we never had a nuclear family and thus aren't preserving one.







Part 6: In closing, at least for now

16. Homeschooling makes sense, even for non homeschoolers and government
October 2023 has been a month worth celebrating by most South Africans. While the consecutive World Cup victories of South Africa were undoubtedly remarkable, they paled in comparison to the true cause for celebration among the majority of South Africans.
Many sports enthusiasts were thrilled to watch the game from beginning to end without any interruptions caused by power outages. The benefits of improved traffic flow, thanks to properly functioning traffic lights and streetlights, were undeniable, regardless of whether one had ever watched a single game.
When going to the shop or government services, it is often uncertain that they would be open. And even when they are, there was a possibility that they would suddenly close when the person was next in line to be served. This could happen after waiting in line for half a day, and having to take paid time off work. It would have been a stretch to expect government offices to improve but at least private shops and services worked with minimal interruptions.
There were less worries about food going spoiled because the fridge was off for too long. Imagine being interrupted while cooking and having to stop midway, only to resort to ordering an expensive takeaway once again. Very little of that was experienced by most in October.
Until now, the country was experiencing ever-increasing load shedding with 2023 being the worst year. Being without power for 50 percent of the day became a norm with some going for days without power restored.
The question for some of us was what brought this turn of events about? Did Eskom make inroads in fixing the problems that got us here? Could it be that instead of being another burden on taxpayers, the appointment of an electricity minister by our president is actually yielding positive results?


16.1. The case against centralisation, Electricity supply as an example
As it turns out, this relief was primarily driven by private individuals who made a conscious choice to decrease their dependence on the grid or even disconnect from it completely. The collective impact of our actions was undeniably significant.
Faced with intense power cuts with seemingly no end in sight, South African households and businesses are increasingly turning to alternative energy sources.
Data from Eskom and Professor Anton Eberhard revealed that South African households and businesses had installed 4,400 MW of rooftop solar PV.
Eberhard posted data from Eskom, which showed that the country’s installed solar rooftop PV increased from 983 MW in March 2022 to 4,412 MW in June 2023 – a 349 percent increase as reported by Bianke Neethling, Daily Investor.
So, how did we get here?
According to Good Governance South Africa Eskom's total installed capacity increased from 1500 MegaWatts (MW) to 40 000 in 1990. This capacity only increased to 45 000 MW in 2022. In 2021, 87.4 percent of the urban population in South Africa had access to electricity, which is a significant increase from the 24 percent in 1996. The rural population, on the other hand, had increased electricity access to 93.4 percent by 2021. This information is from The World Bank.
Although it may initially appear that the major issue lies in the failure to adequately enhance or sustain the supply to meet the soaring demand, this was only part of the problem. One of the biggest problems was the government approach to supplying electricity, with Eskom being a monopoly thus centralising supply to the government.
The first time I saw a source of electricity other than the TV battery at home was solar power. This was in the late 80's early 90's in rural Transkei, long before we could even dream of the villages being connected to the grid.
I found this very interesting because my teacher's family did not have to make trips to town to charge the battery. They were free from the anxiety of dealing with the infamous acid leaks that corroded our trousers as my cousin and I transported the battery to the workshop in town.
The older I grew and more I thought about this, the more convinced I would have it someday. The solution was not only elegant, but cost-effective for individuals and taxpayers. This is because there was no need to construct expensive distribution infrastructure in rural villages, where homes are spread far apart.
There was no risk of vandalism that would cripple the whole village because each individual's supply with a PV setup is in their private property. Rural areas have access to alternative sources of energy like firewood and dried cow dung, which are still commonly used. These help to reduce the demand with most people using electricity only for lights, television, charging mobile devices and refrigerators.
There are several advantages to having houses spread out, as opposed to having densely packed high-rise buildings in the city. One major benefit is the reduced demand for electricity, which allows for the installation of small solar panels on individual homes. Additionally, rural homes often come with spacious yards that can accommodate outdoor fireplaces, without causing any safety concerns or inconveniences for neighbouring houses.
However, this approach would never have provided a valid justification for the exorbitant amount of tax money that was extorted from taxpayers for years under the pretence of bailing out Eskom, only to be redirected into the pockets of corrupt individuals.
Furthermore, this approach would be ineffective due to the ruling party's consistent actions over the past three decades, which have only served to weaken the position of rural residents and property owners by denying them proper security of tenure. The ruling party, which has been in power since the early 90s, has failed to abolish the tribal property system, despite their claims to prioritize people's right to property, especially for those who were previously denied this right.
The government's policies have perpetually caused a lack of investment in rural South Africa, which is one of the major factors fuelling the migration towards urban cities. In urban South Africa, private property owners have the right to borrow against their property and use the funds for investment. These have helped boost the local economy by enabling people to start businesses or other economically beneficial ventures.
Solar energy has become increasingly popular due to the accessibility of borrowing money against properties for solar panel investments. This is because installing solar panels improves the value of their property. Try that in tribal land, that is held in trust with no title deeds.
Although South Africa missed this opportunity, what was true during its early days as a democratic country is now once again prevailing. Government is incapable of solving people's problems no matter how much they have extorted for the causes. The relief we feel now from load shedding is in spite of the government, not because of it. It is because private individuals are opting to stay out of the electricity grid.
Their investment benefits not only themselves but also provides more electricity for those who cannot afford alternative sources. Despite the government persistently burdening taxpayers while the electricity supply deteriorates day by day, the efforts of private individuals are stepping in to address not only their own issues but also benefiting the majority of the population in the country.


16.2. The case for homeschooling, for everyone's benefit
The formal schooling system has failed dismally in producing the returns it promised, this despite its ever-increasing budget that takes more and more from the taxpayer.
Even in the best-case scenario diversifying the modes of education as per parental choices reduces the load on the tax funded formal school system. The results, as is the case with electricity, will ensure the resources left for those who opt to stay in the formal schooling system have better conditions with less congestion in the classrooms.
The overcrowded classes in the formal schooling system have seen the rate of incidents impacting negatively on the children on the rise, with families sometimes losing their children while the taxpayer is stuck with the bill for any litigation against the department.
The urban migration trends fuelled by the lack of investment in rural South Africa mean the remaining children are forced to travel long distances to school as nearby schools close. In a country with warzone rivalling murders and high level of criminality this means these children’s lives are at risk. Natural events like flooding coupled with deteriorating road infrastructure where it existed also increase the risk to these children’s lives and wellbeing. 
Anyone who has ever attended the formal schooling system will attest to its ability to restrict one’s scope of thinking and creativity. Adopted on a mass scale, as we have the formal schooling system means this unified restricted way of thinking is now ubiquitous to everyone’s detriment in the long term, even the cronies that benefit in the immediate.
Informal schooling’s benefits are the reason why we are all alive. Until recently formal schooling was unknown to most and this is still the case with some peoples. No physical imparity, other than that which impairs the intellect, thus reasoning can justify anyone pretending not to see the curse that has been imparted in the current and future generations by broad based policy approaches in the formal schooling system.
Diversifying alleviates the burden on everyone, starting from the child that doesn’t have to wake up at ungodly hours for 12 years of their lives investing most of their childhood to a formal school only to end up being unable to provide for even themselves, let alone their family. Parents and guardians will have the opportunity to maximise the time they spend with their children when they are most impressionable and when it matters the most, no knowledge has been half as valuable in my life than self-knowledge, learned by knowing myself, through my parents and family. The people who still have an authentic interest in the formal schooling system will have an opportunity to give their best effort under conditions that are conducive to the children's learning, instead of being set up for failure by overcrowded classes and under-resourced schools.
 










Acknowledgements

I am very grateful to my parents for being my first teachers and for having the greatest impact on my life even now. I am constantly inspired by my father's wisdom, and I am grateful that my mother continues to share her own.
Before there were empowered women, there were powerful women. I am grateful to all powerful women, past and present. I am the man I am because of a powerful woman.
Buggz, thanks for being a catalyst, long before you were. This is for you, you and your cousin’s benefit, now and tomorrow.
My sisters, who have always been by my side. Although I possess a plethora of abilities, there is an abundance of skills that I lack or simply do not have enough time in a day for, yet they compliment me.
My uncle became a father figure after my father died. He taught me to be a resilient man who can stand up and face adversities. I learned from him and became a better uncle to my nephews.
My grandparents, especially my grandfathers, played a key role in raising my parents and teaching them values that they have passed on to me. This tradition is something we practice with pride, and I eagerly look forward to passing it down to my boys.
I am deeply grateful to my ancestors, many of whom never received a formal education. However, their resilience and determination allowed them to not only survive, but also to raise future generations who persevered through similar challenges. 
I am deeply grateful to my partner for her invaluable input throughout the process of writing this book. 
Big brother and little brother, thanks for always being there. To the fathers and father figures who have inspired me—the MC, MX, and so many others—whose individual influence has contributed to all that I am, thank you. To the many others whom I can’t mention, irrespective of where we met, know that I would be less of a father without you.
I am grateful to my son's mother; without her, I would have never realized the best part of me. May your son be as enlightening to you as he is as guiding to me, long before he was born.
I have experienced a remarkable journey, transitioning from the humble villages of rural Transkei, where I spent the majority of my childhood, to pursuing education and employment in bustling urban cities of South Africa. Nothing can ever replace the profound impact of the real-life experiences I have had with the people I have encountered.
This book is dedicated to my teachers, those who tried their best to do their job. Despite my criticism against the formal education system, this is not meant to ignore the efforts of good teachers. 
Outside of my family, there has been no greater influence on constructing my life's philosophy than that of Dr Thomas Sowell. His extensive research, published in many books on various topics, including education, has greatly influenced my thinking. Even though I have gone through Basic Economics and Knowledge and Decisions at least once a year since 2018, each time I always learn something new.
I would be amiss if I didn’t thank those experiences that despite being unpleasant, they taught me valuable lessons and prepared me for bigger challenges in my life. The same goes for the people who were this way, the teachers that not only didn’t do their jobs but went out of their way to put me down. I am grateful for your lessons, in my life, there is nothing so bad no good can come of it. 
I would be amiss if I didn’t express my gratitude to the multitude of platforms, websites and creators who make information accessible. I am old enough to remember when getting one resource was a laborious task, that was manual, thus time consuming, that took multiple trips to sparsely equipped libraries.

Preface
In my journey of self-discovery, I recently published a book titled "Getting to Know Yourself as a South African: Unravelling Xhosa History: A Journey from Central Africa to South Africa." This work traces the history of the Xhosa people, predominantly found in the  former Transkei, now Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Initially, this endeavour was for my own benefit, as I sought to understand more about myself and, subsequently, the diverse peoples of South Africa and the world to find my place within this tapestry. One of the most fascinating revelations was the extensive migration of the Xhosa people, with distant roots in central Africa, ultimately leading to their settlement in the Eastern Cape. This migration meant that many of my ancestors died along the way, leaving their remains scattered and often unburied.
Throughout my life, I have been deeply immersed in the traditions of the Xhosa people, particularly the veneration of ancestors. This reference is not solely out of choice but also because of my life circumstances and my position as the firstborn male in my family. When my father died when I was 11, it became my duty to succeed him. In succeeding him, I knew that the same obligations that applied to me would apply to my son. These burdens shaped my life, and I resolved to shield my son from such weight. 
This reverence manifests through rituals, starting with the funeral, which demands traditional slaughterings and ceremonies, all of which come at a price, and continuing with visits to graves as a means of communication with the ancestors. However, with my newfound knowledge of our migratory history, I began to question whether we should honour only those ancestors whose graves we know. Considering not only the migratory history but also the prospective future for my son in today's world, where people migrate not only from their villages but across countries and continents, I pondered how to free him from the physical burdens that restrained me so that he could be whatever he wanted to be, wherever in the world and continent.
This question deepened when I encountered this passage: 
"In olden times, when common people died, their corpses were dragged away to a short distance from the kraal and there left to be devoured by beasts of prey; but chiefs and great men were interred with much ceremony. A grave was dug, in which the body was placed in a sitting posture, and by it were deposited his weapons of war and ornaments. When it was closed, such expressions as these were used: 'Remember us from where you are. You have gone to high places. Cause us to prosper!'”
George McCall Theal, “Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk-Lore”

This historical context implies that many of my ancestors did not have graves, raising the question of where my people connected with their ancestors and Qamata (God). Even when graves were known, the tumultuous history of the Xhosa, marked by migrations and conflicts like the Mfecane, often meant that our ancestors' graves could not be visited consistently. This led me to ponder whether the physical disconnection from an ancestor's remains severed our spiritual connection with Qamata.
Growing up in rural Transkei, I often encountered abandoned places, referred to as "Kwa-Zwelidala" (the old world), where our people once lived. These places, now reclaimed by nature, must have housed the remains of ancestors. Did this mean that those who lived in Kwa-Zwelidala sacrificed their connection to Qamata?
Logically, we all descend from a common ancestor, created by Qamata, forming an unbroken chain. Biologically, I can trace myself to the first man through the Y chromosome passed to me by my father, right through to my ancestral father. Similarly, within me, I carry my mitochondrial DNA, my direct link to my ancestral mother, without whom I wouldn't be. If connecting with Qamata relied solely on knowing the locations of all our ancestors' graves, most of us would be lost, as few can trace their lineage beyond a few generations.
Personally, I have never visited the graves of my grandmothers, as both my parents lost their mothers at a young age. I only know the graves of my grandfathers because they died when I was old enough to attend their funerals. Among them, my maternal grandfather holds a special place in my heart for his kindness and support during my father's illness.
Practically, this means that I would never connect with my grandmothers if a physical grave were the only way to link with ancestors and Qamata. The more I reflected, the less sense it made to attach such significance to physical reminders like graves. Considering my son's future, who might relocate to another country, would his children lose their connection to me if they could not locate my grave?
I realised that I need to look inward, not outward, for a connection with my ancestors. Wherever I am, I embody my ancestors within me. Their physical influence and wisdom are carried in my genes, and my spirit is a continuation of theirs. Restricting a spirit to a grave limits its reach. The essence of death is to free the spirit from physical burdens. By confining it to a grave, we limit its omnipresence. I am the culmination of the physical embodiment of my ancestors. To connect with them, I look inward. Spiritually, their spirits need to be free, like Qamata, to be everywhere they are needed in the physical realm.
This book, “Beyond the Grave: A Son's Journey Through Xhosa Tradition, Spirituality, and Freedom” explores this introspective journey, shedding light on the spiritual omnipresence of ancestors and the broader understanding of our connection to Qamata, integrating Xhosa tradition with scientific and biological perspectives. Through this synthesis, I hope to demonstrate the consistency and harmony between our ancestral reverence and our biological heritage.




A Son's Inheritance: The Weight of Tradition and Responsibility
I was eleven years old when my father died, thrusting me into a role I was far from ready to assume. As the firstborn and only son, I knew that one day I would succeed my father—it was what my culture and tradition demanded. But I never expected that day to come so soon.
Our home in the Eastern Cape, nestled in the heart of Xhosa territory, became a place of mixed emotions. It was where I had my happiest childhood memories, but also where I watched my father's life ebb away. The walls that once echoed with his laughter now stood as silent reminders of the duty I had inherited.

A Family's Journey
My parents' story was one of progress and determination. From a rented one-room rondavel in Mahasana to our own home in Drayini, they had worked tirelessly to provide for our family. Each step of our journey—from Mahasana to Newtown, and finally to Drayini—marked progress in our family's trajectory.
But just as we seemed to be reaching new heights, tragedy struck. My father died in the very home he had built for us, leaving behind a legacy of both achievement and unfulfilled potential.

The Burden of Expectation
My family—my mother and three sisters—looked to me as the new head of our household. This expectation was further complicated by the traditional roles my parents had assumed. As I grappled with my new responsibilities, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of anger and frustration. I had hoped my father would prepare me for this role, but his work had kept him away from home for long stretches of time.

Ancestral Bonds: The Xhosa Worldview
To understand the weight of my inheritance, one must grasp the deep-rooted significance of ancestors in Xhosa culture. For us, death is not an end but a transition. Our ancestors are ever-present, guiding us, protecting us, and at times, chastising us when we stray from our path.

A Clash of Worlds and a Journey of Discovery
However, this traditional worldview increasingly clashes with modern influences. Christianity, Western education, and urban migration have complicated our relationship with these age-old beliefs. As a young man straddling these two worlds, I found myself questioning, reevaluating, and ultimately reimagining my cultural inheritance.
The tragedy of my father's untimely death became the catalyst for my in-depth investigation into my culture and Christianity. I was determined to understand and document these aspects of my life, not just for myself, but for my future son. I wanted to ensure that even if I were to die young, he would have a starting point in understanding his role and heritage.

The Power of a Name
My journey of understanding began with my very name. While my grandfather had named my father Mlandeli, meaning "to follow," my father chose a different path for me. He named me Salatiso, which roughly translates to "show us the way." This name, dreamt by my father before my birth, carried with it the weight of expectation and the freedom to pioneer.
I came to understand that my grandfather's choice of name for my father was likely influenced by the turbulent times he lived in—a country grappling with the collision of traditional Xhosa beliefs and Western values brought by colonisation. The oppressive apartheid laws that impacted the Xhosa people likely made my grandfather cautious, urging my father to play it safe and not question authority.
But my father had different aspirations for me. He wanted me to question the norm, lead rather than follow. This ethos was exemplified in a memory from when I was about six years old. After receiving my report card, my father praised my top ranking but then delved into a detailed discussion about the class averages. He taught me never to measure myself against the norm but to always strive for my best performance.

The Intersection of Tradition and Modernity
My father's approach to Christianity offered another perspective on bridging tradition and modernity. He was more serious about church than my mother, even taking on responsibilities in the Wesley Methodist Church. What I came to appreciate about Christianity, even when I didn't believe in it for myself, was its emphasis on written records.
Unlike the oral traditions of my people, Christianity offered tangible records that one could read and interpret for oneself. This appreciation for written knowledge was reflected in my parents' insistence on always providing us with books and access to education.

The Wisdom in Oral Tradition
It would take me almost four decades to understand the ingenuity of not writing but rather passing knowledge orally. Our ancestors seemed to understand the rapid pace of change in the world and didn't want future generations to be bound by outdated practices simply because they were written down.

The Core of Xhosa Tradition
I came to realise that the central message of Xhosa tradition and spirituality revolves around respect for one's family as the gateway to connecting with our god. This respect extends to both living and deceased. However, I began to question the common interpretation that this respect necessitated an attachment to physical remains and monuments.

Contextual Rather Than Literal
As I observed the variations in traditional practices across the Eastern Cape, I realised that Xhosa tradition was contextual rather than literal. Practices varied based on geography, available resources, and other local factors. This realisation allowed me to approach our traditions with a critical eye, questioning and interpreting cultural practices to determine their relevance—a skill my father had nurtured in me.

The Central Dilemma: Honouring the Past, Embracing the Future
At the heart of my story lies a question that has haunted me since childhood: What should I do with my father's remains? This wasn't merely a logistical problem; it was a profound spiritual and cultural dilemma that touched the very core of my identity as a Xhosa man.
As I embarked on this journey of questioning and discovery, I didn't realise that in seeking to lay my father's remains to rest, I would ultimately find a new understanding of life, death, and the enduring connections that bind us all. More importantly, I would find a way to honour my heritage while forging a path that would allow my own son the freedom to navigate his world without the burdensome yoke I had inherited.






The Weight of Tradition
In Xhosa culture, ancestral veneration is not merely a personal choice—it's a societal imperative. As I grew older, I became acutely aware of my community's watchful eyes and whispered judgments. Ironically, these pressures never came from my immediate family. My mother understood the burden of being a provider, a role I had assumed since I was 20. She appreciated my prioritisation of caring for her and my sisters, who were alive and had tangible needs—just as my father had done during his lifetime.
Neighbours and extended family members began voicing their opinions, sometimes directly, often indirectly. "When will you perform the ritual for your father?" they would ask, their tone a mixture of curiosity and expectation. Some were bolder, suggesting that my success in life—my education, my career—was directly linked to my father's spiritual satisfaction.
The pressure was relentless and multifaceted. There was financial strain from providing for my mother and sisters while building my own life. Rituals and ceremonies were expensive, requiring livestock sacrifices and hosting numerous guests. The outstanding ritual—bringing my father's spirit back home—was particularly demanding. It required slaughtering a cow and other livestock to entertain and feed family members, some travelling from afar to celebrate and make appeals to the spirits, ultimately to Qamata.
Emotional pressure came from the implication that I was neglecting my father's spirit, failing in my duties as a son. Cultural pressure stemmed from the fear that not adhering strictly to these traditions somehow made me less Xhosa, less connected to my roots.
Despite my mother's understanding and my father's teachings, I can't pretend this pressure didn't affect me. It created a constant undercurrent of anxiety in my life. Every achievement was tempered by nagging guilt, every setback interpreted as possible ancestral displeasure. It was a weight I carried silently, unsure how to reconcile these expectations with my evolving worldview and the practical realities of my life.

Childhood memories and early understanding
My earliest memories of my father are a mixture of love, admiration, and a child's incomprehension of mortality. I remember his strong hands guiding mine as he taught me woodworking, his deep voice recounting ancestral stories by the fireside, and even the sting of the sjambok when I carelessly left tools outside. These fragmented, fleeting memories became precious anchors to a time before tradition's weight fell upon my shoulders.
As a child, I understood death simply—someone was here, then they were not. The complex spirituality surrounding death in our culture was beyond my grasp. I watched, wide-eyed and confused, as adults performed rituals I didn't understand, speaking to spirits I couldn't see.
One memory stands out vividly: my father's funeral. The solemn atmosphere, the gathering of unfamiliar people, the haunting traditional songs—it all seemed surreal. It was perhaps the first time I'd seen my mother at her weakest, a vulnerability she never displayed even during my father's illness. I watched a cow being slaughtered, its life given to accompany my father on his journey. At eleven years old, I couldn't fully comprehend the significance, but I sensed the gravity of the moment. It was my first real encounter with the intricate dance between life, death, and spiritual belief in our culture.

Coming of age and assuming responsibilities
As I entered my teens, the abstract concept of 'succeeding my father' began to take concrete form. As the only male in the house, some traditional practices demanded my involvement, even as a teenager, albeit with help from my mother and uncles.
With each passing year, the responsibilities grew. I juggled school demands with my mother's financial constraints, living off my father's pension, which had to support us all. The expectations of being the family's spiritual leader weighed heavily. I had to learn quickly; while urban areas might allow escape from tradition's hold, in our rural village, shared traditions meant strict enforcement, even if only through gossip about unacceptable conduct.
This period was marked by a profound sense of inadequacy. How could I, still a boy in many ways, fill the shoes of a man I was still grieving? Nights found me awake, overwhelmed by expectations, yearning for guidance from the very person whose absence had thrust me into this role.
Yet, slowly, I began to grow into these responsibilities. Each small decision, each ritual performed, each family crisis navigated, added to my confidence. I was becoming the man my father had hoped I would be, even as I grappled with what that truly meant.

Performing the initial rituals
All necessary rituals but one had been performed after my father's death. The final ritual came when I was in my early 30s, finally able to say his wife and daughters were stable enough, and I could afford the necessary sacrifices. Until then, I reasoned that had he been alive, he would have prioritised the living over the dead, so I prioritised his children and wife before his remains.
The preparation was exciting and terrifying. I consulted with elders, ensuring every detail was correct. The weight of getting it right—for my father, for my family, for my community—was immense.

On the ritual day, I stood before the gathered family, a sharp knife in hand, facing the cow to be sacrificed. The moment was surreal—enacting an ancient tradition, a link in a chain stretching back countless generations.
As I plunged the dagger into the cow, emotions rushed through me—grief for my father, pride in fulfilling my duty, and a strange sense of connection to something larger than myself. The cow's life ebbed away, and I could almost feel the veil between physical and spiritual worlds thinning.
The rest of the ritual passed in a blur—preparing meat, sharing meals, prayers and invocations to the ancestors. I watched my extended family celebrate, not mourn. They came from far and wide, each with their own appeals to my father's returning spirit.
As the day ended, I felt exhausted yet relieved. I had performed the ritual, fed my family and community, and honoured my father. Yet, even as I basked in accomplishment, a small voice whispered that this was just the beginning of my journey, not its end.

Questioning and Conflict
As I delved deeper into our traditions, the subtle yet pervasive influence of Christianity on Xhosa spiritual practices became increasingly apparent. This realisation sparked a period of intense questioning and internal conflict, leading me to examine the very foundations of my cultural identity.

The Interplay of Traditions
The parallels between Xhosa traditions and Christianity were striking. Just as Christianity speaks of Jesus' death and resurrection, our Xhosa rituals describe the spirit leaving the home only to be welcomed back later. Both belief systems incorporate intermediaries between humans and the divine - ancestors for us, saints or Jesus for Christians.
However, a crucial difference emerged. In Xhosa tradition, my connection to Qamata (our creator) is facilitated through my family lineage. This necessitates nurturing these relationships through my conduct. Christianity, on the other hand, is authority-based; connection with God is achieved through Jesus, a figure with whom I, as a Xhosa man from Transkei, have no physical or genetic relation.
This realisation deepened my appreciation for our ancestral system. Without each of my predecessors, I wouldn't exist. Through them, I can trace a genetic link to my creator. My ancestors have a vested interest in my wellbeing because, for all their might in the spiritual realm, they can only act through the living. It's a mutually beneficial relationship - they need me as much as I need them.

Questioning Traditions
I found myself wondering: How much of what we practise is truly 'traditional'? How much has been shaped by centuries of interaction with Christian missionaries and colonisers? These questions were not merely academic - they struck at the heart of my identity and my understanding of our cultural heritage.
My ability to ask these questions was partly a privilege of my circumstances. Since the age of 13, I had been away from the village pursuing formal education and employment, visiting only during school breaks and work vacations. My mother, fearing for my safety after losing my father, had arranged for me to live with my uncle in another province. This environment, less dominated by Xhosa culture, provided some distance from the scrutiny of traditionalists who saw themselves as enforcers of cultural requirements.

Personal Doubts and Internal Struggles
As my understanding grew, so did my doubts. I questioned practices I had once accepted without thought. Why did we need to sacrifice animals to communicate with our ancestors? If our ancestors were truly omnipresent, why did we need to perform rituals at specific locations?
These doubts created a profound internal struggle. On one hand, I felt a deep connection to these practices - they were a link to my father, to my community, to centuries of Xhosa history. On the other hand, my rational mind grappled with aspects that seemed at odds with my evolving worldview.
Nights became battlegrounds of conflicting thoughts. Was I betraying my heritage by questioning these traditions? Or was critical thinking itself a form of respect, a way of engaging deeply with my culture rather than blindly accepting it? 
Importantly, I knew that my parents had always encouraged questioning. They expected me to challenge traditions so that I could chart an appropriate course for my family based on sound reasoning rather than blind adherence to custom.

The Urban-Rural Divide
The conflict extended beyond the spiritual realm. As I built my career and moved to more urban areas, I felt the pull between modern life and traditional obligations. How could I balance the demands of my professional life with the time-consuming nature of these rituals? Was there a way to honour my ancestors that aligned with my contemporary lifestyle?
This urban-rural divide became a metaphor for the broader tensions I was experiencing. In the city, I was exposed to diverse perspectives and modern ways of thinking. Yet, each return to my rural roots brought me face to face with the expectations and traditions of my community. Navigating this divide became a central challenge in my journey.

Balancing Filial Duty with Personal Beliefs
Perhaps the most challenging aspect of this period was reconciling my sense of filial duty with my evolving personal beliefs. I knew that my father, had he lived, would have expected me to uphold these traditions. Yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that true respect for his memory meant being true to myself and my own understanding of the world.
I grappled with guilt. Each time I questioned a practice or considered not performing a ritual, I felt as if I was somehow betraying my father's memory. The weight of generations seemed to rest on my shoulders, and the fear of being the one to break the chain was almost paralysing.

Reframing Filial Duty
Yet, slowly, I began to reframe my understanding of filial duty. I reflected on my father's life - how he had adapted traditions to suit changing times, how he had encouraged me to think for myself. Would he really want me to blindly follow practices I didn't fully believe in?
I started to see that my duty to my father and my ancestors wasn't about unthinking adherence to tradition, but about living with integrity, making conscious choices, and carrying forward the best of our culture while allowing it to evolve.
This realisation was both liberating and terrifying. It meant that I had to take responsibility for shaping my own relationship with our traditions, with my ancestors, with my father's memory. It meant making choices that might not always align with community expectations.

 The Path Forward
As I stood at this crossroads, I knew that the path forward wouldn't be easy. But I also knew that it was necessary - not just for me, but for future generations who would grapple with these same questions. In questioning and seeking understanding, I was not betraying my heritage, but engaging with it in the deepest possible way.
This period of questioning and conflict became a crucible for my personal growth. It forced me to confront the complexities of cultural identity in a rapidly changing world. I began to see that honouring my heritage didn't mean preserving it in amber, but rather allowing it to grow and adapt while retaining its core values.
As I moved forward, I carried with me a new understanding: that tradition and progress need not be at odds. By questioning, by seeking to understand, by adapting where necessary, I could honour my ancestors in a way that was authentic to my lived experience. This, I realised, was the true essence of filial duty - not blind obedience, but thoughtful engagement and evolution.



The Physical and the Spiritual
As my journey of questioning continued, I found myself returning to the fundamental Xhosa concept of burial: 'umhlaba emhlabeni, uthuli eluthulini' - earth to earth, dust to dust. This phrase, spoken at every funeral, began to take on new depths of meaning for me.
I pondered the symbolism inherent in this ritual. The act of returning the body to the earth is a powerful acknowledgment of the cycle of life and death. It speaks to the temporary nature of our physical existence and the eternal nature of our spiritual essence.

The Burden and Revelation of Grave Maintenance
One of my first burdens towards my father after he died was the maintenance of his grave, a physically demanding job that could mostly be done by me as the only male in the home. I had the primary responsibility of cleaning around my father’s grave, shovelling all the weeds and making sure that the grave was always well-maintained and visible, as one would do when maintaining a home for the living. One day, visiting my father's grave, the full weight of this concept struck me. I watched as wind blew across the mound, carrying away small particles of soil. At that moment, I realised that my father's physical form was already becoming one with the earth, fulfilling the promise of 'umhlaba emhlabeni'.
This realisation led me to question: If we truly believe that the spirit is separate from the body, why do we place so much emphasis on the physical remains? Why does the location of a grave hold such significance if the spirit is free?

The Limitations of Confining Spirits to Physical Locations

As I grappled with these questions, I began to see the limitations of our traditional approach to ancestor veneration. We often acted as if our ancestors' spirits were confined to their graves or to specific locations where we performed rituals.
Having traced my roots from Central Africa in my previous book, I realised the utter shortsightedness of confining our ancestors to the graves that we could see. Considering to get to what is now the Eastern Cape, we left so many of our ancestors along the way. Did this now mean because we couldn’t see their graves that the link is broken? This was illogical because the link to Qamata is continuous and unbroken from myself to my first parents, something that has been confirmed by science and biology. Cutting this link by only confining our ancestors to the graves we see would mean that it ends long before reaching Qamata. Within me there is also the Khoisan who mixed with some of my ancestors, but just as the Xhosa migrated to Transkei, the Khoisan had been nomadic for about 10,000 years with no fixed graves.
Until King Tshawe’s reign and the final consolidation by King Hintsa, the Xhosa Kingdom did not exist but rather many tribes coexisted in the KZN area along with other descendants of Mnguni. This means that even within the last 400 years, we can’t trace our graves for more than two or three generations. And what of those people that perished in the wild due to weather, nature, or animals and their remains were never found? Did this mean their descendants would have no link to Qamata? Many people even to modern day perished in violent wars and dangerous accidents with some men who worked in the mines dying underground with their bodies never to be found. Did these people no longer have a connection to Qamata?
In recent history alone there were many forced removals from places people called home through the bloody tribal wars in the KZN and Eastern Cape area right through to the bloody Mfecane and conquest by the colonisers, and forced removals during apartheid. Did these people no longer have a connection to Qamata? While slavery was not the norm in South Africa, there were people in the early days after colonisation who took up jobs which saw them venture into the sea never to be seen again when their ships perished before returning home. Did the descendants of these people no longer have a tie to their ancestors?

Rethinking the Connection Between Ancestors and Descendants
As I continued to reflect, I began to reconsider the nature of my connection to my ancestors, particularly my father. If his spirit wasn't confined to his grave or our old homestead, where was it? The answer, when it came to me, was simple and profound: within me.
I realised that my father - and all my ancestors - lived on through me in the most tangible way possible. Their genes shaped my physical form, their teachings influenced my thoughts and actions, their experiences were woven into the fabric of my life story.
This epiphany led me to a new understanding of ancestor veneration. Instead of looking outward to connect with my ancestors, I began to look inward. I started to see myself not just as an individual, but as the current embodiment of a long line of ancestors stretching back through time.
This shift in perspective was liberating. It meant I carried my ancestors with me wherever I went. I didn't need to be in a specific location or perform a particular ritual to connect with them. They were part of me, influencing my life in countless ways every day.

The Responsibility of Ancestral Legacy
At the same time, this realisation came with a profound sense of responsibility. If I was the living manifestation of my ancestors, then my actions and choices would shape how future generations connected with their ancestral heritage. It was up to me to live in a way that honoured this legacy while adapting it for the modern world.
As I stood at my father's crumbling gravesite, I no longer felt the anguish of abandonment or the weight of unfulfilled duty. Instead, I felt a deep sense of peace and connection. My father wasn't confined to this spot of earth - he was with me, part of me, guiding me as I navigated my own path through life.

Embracing the Infinite
This new understanding didn't negate the value of our traditional practices. Rather, it added a new dimension to them. Rituals and gravesites became not the sole points of connection with our ancestors, but powerful symbols and reminders of the continuous thread connecting past, present, and future.
In embracing this infinite connection, I found a deeper, more meaningful way to honour my ancestors. They were no longer bound by the constraints of physical locations. Instead, they lived on through the lives they touched, the stories they told, and the legacies they left behind.
My journey through questioning and understanding transformed my perspective on ancestral veneration. It allowed me to bridge the gap between tradition and modernity, finding a harmonious balance that honoured the past while embracing the present and future.


Freeing the Spirit, Embracing the Self
My journey of questioning led me to a profound realisation about the nature of spirits and our connection to them. I began to understand that by fixating on physical remains and specific locations, we were inadvertently limiting the very beings we sought to honour.
One day, as I stood before my father's weathered grave, a thought struck me with the force of revelation: My father had been freed from the constraints of physical existence. Why, then, was I insisting on binding his spirit to this patch of earth?
I remembered the words spoken at every Xhosa funeral: 'umhlaba emhlabeni, uthuli eluthulini'. We acknowledge that the body returns to the earth, but what of the spirit? Surely, it must be free to roam, to exist beyond the confines of space and time.
This realisation was both liberating and humbling. It meant that my father's spirit wasn't abandoned in our old home, nor was it trapped in the grave. It was free, unbounded, perhaps even omnipresent. The weight of guilt I had carried for years began to lift, replaced by a sense of wonder at the vastness of spiritual existence.

The Importance of Genetic and Spiritual Inheritance
As I embraced this new understanding, I began to see my connection to my ancestors, particularly my father, in a new light. I realised that the most tangible link between us wasn't a grave or a ritual site, but the very essence of who I am.
I started to pay attention to the subtle ways my father lived on through me - in my mannerisms, my values, even in my physical features. I saw how his teachings had shaped my worldview, how his experiences had influenced my choices.
This genetic and spiritual inheritance, I realised, was far more significant than any physical artefact. It was a living, breathing connection to my ancestors, one that evolved and grew with each passing day.
I remember looking at my hands one day and seeing my father's hands - strong, capable, marked by years of hard work. In that moment, I felt a surge of connection far more powerful than any I had experienced through traditional rituals. My father wasn't gone; he was here, a part of me, living on through my actions and choices.


Finding Ancestors Within Oneself
This shift in perspective led me to a revolutionary idea: the truest connection to our ancestors lies within ourselves. Instead of looking outward for spiritual connection, I began to look inward.
I started to see myself not just as an individual, but as a living embodiment of all my ancestors. Their strengths, their struggles, their wisdom - all of it was woven into the fabric of my being. This understanding brought with it a profound sense of responsibility and purpose.
I realised that honouring my ancestors wasn't just about performing rituals or maintaining gravesites. It was about living in a way that respected their legacy while adapting to the present and preparing for the future. It was about recognizing their influence in my life and using that awareness to guide my choices.
This inward focus didn't mean abandoning our traditions. Rather, it added depth and personal meaning to our practices. When I participated in rituals, I did so with a new understanding - not as someone beseeching distant spirits, but as someone acknowledging the ancestral wisdom within himself.
I began to see every choice, every action as a way of connecting with my ancestors. When I made decisions that aligned with the values my father had taught me, I felt his approval not as a distant spiritual force, but as an integral part of my own conscience.
This new perspective was transformative. It freed me from the geographical constraints of ancestor veneration. No matter where I went, no matter how far from my father's grave or our old homestead, I carried my ancestors with me. They were part of me, guiding me, supporting me.
Moreover, this understanding helped me bridge the gap between our traditional beliefs and the modern world. I could honour my ancestors not just through prescribed rituals, but through my daily life - through my work, my relationships, my contributions to society.
As I embraced this new way of connecting with my ancestors, I felt a sense of peace and purpose that had eluded me for years. The anxiety about neglecting my duties faded, replaced by a deep-seated confidence in my spiritual connection.
I realised that in freeing my father's spirit from the confines of the grave, I had also freed myself - from guilt, from rigid interpretations of tradition, and from the fear of losing connection with my roots. In finding my ancestors within myself, I had found a new way forward, one that honoured the past while embracing the future.

The Tip of the Iceberg: Ancestral Multitudes
To truly grasp the significance of our ancestral connections, consider the sheer number of ancestors required for one person to exist. Over a span of 400 years, roughly 16 generations, the number of direct ancestors exponentially increases. Each person has two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, etc. By the 16th generation, the number of ancestors reached into the tens of thousands.
Extending this contemplation further, imagine a lineage tracing back 10,000 years. The numbers become astronomical, involving millions upon millions of individuals. Each of these ancestors played a role. They were prerequisites  in the chain of existence that culminated in the present generation.
What we see and know of our lineage, whether through physical graves or familial stories, represents only a tiny fraction of this vast ancestral network. If our connection to Qamata were based solely on physical connections, we would be so detached from our roots that the bond would seem almost non-existent.
Yet, the true connection is not physical but spiritual and genetic. Within us lies the essence of all those who came before, an unbroken thread that ties us to the beginning of humanity and beyond. This realisation underscores the profound depth of our heritage and the intricate web of life that sustains us.
In recognizing that what we see is just the tip of the iceberg, we gain a deeper appreciation for the vastness of our ancestry. This understanding liberates us from the constraints of physicality, allowing us to honour our ancestors in a more holistic and meaningful way. We are the product of countless lives, each one a vital link in the chain that leads to our existence. By looking within, we find a connection that transcends time and space, a connection that is both humbling and empowering.





Coming Full Circle
Years ago, I made a choice that diverged from the path many others take. Instead of leaving my mother and sisters behind in the Eastern Cape, content to visit them only during vacations or rituals, I decided to bring them with me. Given the Eastern Cape's status as one of the poorest and worst-performing provinces in the country, I knew their chances for a better life were slim if they remained there. The probability was high that I would return more often for funerals than for joyful visits.
As females, my sisters were likely to have children, which they all do now. The likelihood that some fathers would be absent from their children's lives was also high, leaving my nephews and niece in need of a father figure. By default, I became that figure. Despite their combined efforts, my mother and sisters could not provide half the quality of life I could offer. It only made sense to give them a home in my home until they were ready to build their own.
By 2010, when my nephew Solo was born, it was mostly my mother and nephew who lived in my family home. My sisters had moved to Johannesburg to stay with me. Despite not having the means I had hoped for by 2014, my mother spent more time with us along with my nephew until I finally decided she could move up full-time.
With my family now in Johannesburg, I had little immediate reason to go to the Eastern Cape, and I was never eager to return. With no one staying there, my family home slowly started to wither, aided by criminals who were all too happy to help themselves to whatever was left behind. The first time I returned to my childhood home in over six years was in 2024.

Returning to the Eastern Cape
After years of internal struggle and spiritual growth, I finally found the courage to return to my childhood home in the Eastern Cape. As I approached the familiar dirt road leading to our property, a mixture of anticipation and trepidation filled me.
The sight that greeted me was far from the home I remembered. Crumbling walls stood as silent sentinels to the passage of time. The once-sturdy fence that had marked our territory now lay in disrepair, barely visible among the overgrown grass. Nature had begun to reclaim what was once ours.
As I stepped onto the property, memories flooded back. Here was the spot where my father had taught me carpentry, a skill that I have grown such that now I am not only able to build furniture items and perform renovations but frame a wholesale house. There was the tree that used to bear sweet peaches just before what was the small gate of the garden. And in the corner of what was once our yard, a mound of earth marked my father's grave.
I stood before this humble marker, emotions swirling within me. This was the moment I had both longed for and dreaded for years. How would I feel, seeing the physical manifestation of what I had left behind?

The Unexpected Catharsis
To my surprise, as I stood there taking in the scene, I didn't feel the crushing guilt or sorrow I had anticipated. Instead, a profound sense of peace washed over me. The anxiety that had gripped me for years began to dissolve.
I realised that what I was seeing was not abandonment or neglect, but the natural order of things. The crumbling walls, the overgrown grass, even the weathered mound of my father's grave - all of it spoke to the impermanence of the physical world.
In that moment, I truly understood the meaning of 'umhlaba emhlabeni, uthuli eluthulini'. My father had returned to earth, as we all must. The decaying structures around me were not a sign of failure, but a reminder of life's cycles.
I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. The guilt I had carried about leaving my father's remains behind melted away. I saw clearly that his spirit was not confined to this place, just as mine was not tied to the physical structures of my past.

Letting Go of Guilt and Finding Peace
As I stood there, surrounded by the remnants of my childhood home, I began to talk to my father. Not to his grave, but to his spirit that I now understood resided within me and around me.
I shared with him my journey, my struggles, and my new understanding. I thanked him for the lessons he had taught me, both in life and in death. I apologised for the years I had spent feeling guilty, realising now that this was never what he would have wanted for me.
As I spoke, I felt a sense of release. The bonds of obligation that had bound me to this place began to loosen. I realised that I had been carrying the weight of a misunderstood duty for far too long.
I saw that true respect for my father and our ancestors didn't lie in preserving physical remains or structures. It lay in carrying forward their wisdom, their values, and their spirit into the future.
As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the overgrown yard, I felt a profound sense of closure. I had come here seeking reconciliation with my past, and I had found it in the most unexpected way.
I took one last look at the mound that marked my father's grave. 'Thank you,' I whispered, not just to my father, but to this place that had shaped me, to the traditions that had guided me, and to the journey that had brought me to this moment of understanding.
As I walked away from the old homestead, I didn't feel like I was leaving my father behind. Instead, I felt him with me, within me, guiding me forward. I was not abandoning my past; I was carrying it with me into the future, transformed by understanding and acceptance.

By looking within, we find a connection that transcends time and space, a connection that is both humbling and empowering.



Embracing Legacy and Duty
As I drove away from my childhood home, I felt a profound shift in my understanding of duty and legacy. The circle of life—birth, growth, death, and renewal—took on new meaning for me. I realised that my father's duty had been to provide for and guide his family, a role he fulfilled admirably during his too-short life. My duty, I now understood, was not to be bound by the past but to honour it by living fully in the present and preparing for the future. This knowledge I could now pass to my son, my nephews, and my niece, ensuring they never feel burdened or have to start where I did to understand this.
This new perspective transformed how I viewed my responsibilities. Instead of feeling burdened by the obligation to perform specific rituals or maintain a physical gravesite, I felt empowered to carry forward the essence of my father's teachings and our ancestral wisdom in my daily life.
I saw that the truest way to honour my father and our ancestors was to embody their best qualities, learn from their experiences, and build upon the foundation they had laid. This was a living, evolving form of respect—one that could adapt to changing times while maintaining the core values of our culture.

The Omnipresence of Ancestors
Perhaps the most profound shift in my thinking was the realisation that my ancestors, including my father, were not confined to any one place. They were everywhere—in the genes that shaped me, in the values I held, in the very air I breathed.
This understanding liberated me from the geographical constraints that had once defined my connection to my ancestors. I no longer felt that I needed to be in a specific location to commune with them. They were with me always, a part of me, guiding my steps and influencing my decisions.
I began to see signs of their presence in unexpected places—in the resilience I showed when facing challenges, in the wisdom that sometimes surprised me with its depth, in the instinctive actions that echoed the teachings of those who came before me.
This omnipresence of my ancestors became a source of strength and comfort. No matter where life took me, I carried my heritage with me. It was not a burden to bear but a wellspring of identity and guidance to draw upon.

Balancing Respect for Tradition with Personal Growth
With this new understanding came the challenge of finding balance—honouring our traditions while allowing for personal and cultural evolution. I realised that blind adherence to tradition without understanding its purpose could be as harmful as completely abandoning our cultural practices.
I began to approach our rituals and customs with a curious and critical mind, seeking to understand their deeper meanings and relevance to modern life. Some practices, I found, held timeless wisdom that was as applicable today as it was generations ago. Others, I realised, might need to evolve to remain meaningful in a changing world.
This balance became my new goal—to be a bridge between the past and the future, honouring the essence of our traditions while allowing them to grow and adapt. I saw that this approach not only enriched my own life but could also make our cultural heritage more accessible and meaningful to future generations.
In my professional life and personal relationships, I began to integrate aspects of our traditions in ways that felt authentic and relevant. I found that this approach often opened up meaningful dialogues about culture, identity, and values, allowing me to share the richness of our heritage in a way that others could appreciate and understand.
As I embraced this balanced approach, I felt a deep sense of authenticity and purpose. I was no longer torn between tradition and modernity, between duty to the past and aspirations for the future. Instead, I had found a way to honour both, creating a harmonious integration of my heritage and my lived experience.

A Journey of Transformation
This journey of understanding had transformed not just my relationship with my ancestors but my entire worldview. I saw now that our traditions, when understood deeply and practised mindfully, could be a source of strength and guidance in navigating the complexities of the modern world.
As I looked to the future, I felt a sense of excitement and responsibility. I had found my path—one that respected the past, embraced the present, and looked forward to the future. And in doing so, I had found a way to truly honour my father, my ancestors, and the rich cultural tapestry that had shaped me.



Lessons for the Future
I realised that for our traditions to remain relevant, they needed to evolve. While these traditions might add little to no value in directly communicating with our ancestors, they play a crucial role in bringing the family together, so that the living can support each other through hard times and celebrate the good times. We are a social people who, for the longest time, without private property, living a nomadic life, and enduring wars and battles that displaced my ancestors, believed our most valuable investment was in people rather than things. This belief held true then and still holds true now. Traditional activities and ceremonies facilitate those bonds, ensuring that family members know each other, even distant cousins and relations.
In performing my father's last ceremony, I met distant relatives I had never met before, and those I had only met seldomly. Seeing my extended family helped me learn more about myself. With a common ancestor, I could see how some traits I had inherited manifested in them, providing clues on how they might manifest in me. If it was something beneficial, I would amplify it; if it was something undesirable, I could modify it for the positive.
One example of this is my tenacity and determination, which has sometimes led my ancestors and relatives to act out in physical violence—a behaviour that was acceptable and even seen as a sign of courage at one time. However, while brute force might have worked for my ancestors, it is not as effective today. My challenge is to direct this potential for good. This is why I learned the value of physical work—to discharge the anger that drove them to act physically and channel it towards fueling my drive to change my family's future and challenge injustices, no matter how big the Goliath, through legal means that are relevant today.

Finding New Expressions for Core Values
This wasn't about discarding our heritage but about finding new ways to express its core values in a changing world. For instance, the tradition of slaughtering a cow for major ceremonies posed challenges in our urban life. Instead of abandoning the practice entirely, we found ways to maintain its spirit. We would come together as a family to share a meal, each contributing in some way—if not with a cow, then with our time, resources, or skills. The essence of the tradition—coming together in unity and abundance—was maintained, even as its form changed.
I also saw opportunities to blend our traditions with modern practices. These adaptations ensured that our heritage remained a living, breathing part of our lives, guiding us and keeping us connected.

Finding Universal Truths in Cultural Practices
As I shared our traditions with others, including friends from different cultural backgrounds, I began to see the universal truths embedded in our practices. The respect for ancestors, for instance, wasn't unique to Xhosa culture. It reflected a human need to understand our roots and find guidance from those who came before us.
When I explained our traditions in terms of these universal principles, they resonated with people from all walks of life. A colleague once told me how hearing about our ancestral practices had inspired her to delve deeper into her own family history, seeking wisdom from her grandparents' experiences. This universality became a bridge, allowing me to share the richness of our culture without imposing it on others. It opened up meaningful dialogues about values, identity, and the human experience that transcends racial  and cultural boundaries.
I began to see how our Xhosa wisdom could contribute to broader conversations about community, respect for elders, and maintaining connections in an increasingly fragmented world. Our traditions, I realised, held lessons not just for us, but for society as a whole.

Becoming a Custodian of Heritage
As I looked to the future, I felt a sense of hope and purpose. The journey I had undertaken—from unquestioning acceptance, through doubt and conflict, to a new understanding—had equipped me to be a custodian of our heritage. Not as a gatekeeper rigidly enforcing old ways, but as a bridge builder, helping to carry the wisdom of the past into the future.
I saw my role now as not just preserving our traditions but helping them to grow and evolve. To remain living, breathing practices that could continue to guide and inspire, not just within our community, but beyond. The little boy who once stood bewildered at his father's funeral had grown into a man who could honour his ancestors by living fully, adapting wisely, and sharing generously. As I watched Solo and his generation engaging with our heritage in new and meaningful ways, I felt a deep sense of satisfaction. The circle of life continued, and our ancestors' wisdom flowed on, finding new expressions in each generation.
In this way, I realised, my father and all our ancestors lived on—not confined to graves or rituals, but alive in our actions, our values, and the lessons we passed on to the future. And in helping to ensure this continuity, I had found my own place in the great circle of our heritage.





Conclusion
As I reflect on the journey that brought me here, from the confused eleven-year-old boy standing at his father's grave to the man I am today, I'm struck by the profound transformations I've undergone. This journey, born from the simple yet complex question of what to do with my father's remains, has led me through a labyrinth of cultural expectations, personal doubts, and ultimately, to a deeper understanding of myself and my heritage.
The path was not easy. I grappled with the weight of tradition, the pressure of societal expectations, and the internal conflict between honouring my past and embracing my present. There were moments of guilt, periods of questioning, and times when I felt torn between two worlds—the traditional Xhosa world of my ancestors and the modern world I inhabit.
But through this struggle, I've come to a place of peace and understanding that I never thought possible. I've learned that honouring our ancestors isn't about rigid adherence to practices we don't understand, nor is it about preserving their physical remains in a specific location. It's about carrying their wisdom forward, allowing their spirit to live on through our actions and choices.
I've discovered that my father—and all my ancestors—are not confined to a grave or a homestead. They are within me, part of my very being. They live in the values I hold, the decisions I make, and the legacy I'm creating. This realisation has freed me from the geographical and ritual constraints that once defined my connection to them.
Moreover, I've come to see our traditions not as immutable relics of the past, but as living, breathing practices that can and should evolve. The core values and wisdom they embody remain constant, but their expressions can change to remain relevant and meaningful in our changing world. While they might add little to no value in relation to communicating with our ancestors, they play a role in bringing family together, so that the living can support each other through hard times and celebrate the good times. We are a social people who, for the longest time, without private property, nomadic life, and wars that displaced my ancestors, believed our most valuable investment was in people rather than things. Traditional activities and ceremonies facilitate those bonds, ensuring that family members know each other, even distant cousins and relations.

In performing my father's last ceremony, I met distant relatives I had never met before, and those I had only met seldomly. Seeing my extended family helped me learn more about myself.

This is why I learned the value of physical work—to discharge the anger that drove them to act physically and channel it towards fueling my drive to change my family's future and challenge injustices, no matter how big the Goliath, through legal means that are relevant today.
This journey has also shown me the universal truths embedded in our cultural practices. The respect for those who came before us, the importance of understanding our roots, the need for guidance from accumulated wisdom—these are human needs that transcend cultural boundaries. In sharing our traditions, I've found connections with people from all walks of life, bridging divides and fostering understanding. 

A colleague once told me how hearing about our ancestral practices had inspired her to delve deeper into her own family history, seeking wisdom from her grandparents' experiences. This universality became a bridge, allowing me to share the richness of our culture without imposing it on others. It opened up meaningful dialogues about values, identity, and the human experience that transcended race and cultural boundaries. 
I began to see how our Xhosa wisdom could contribute to broader conversations about community, respect for elders, and maintaining connections in an increasingly fragmented world. Our traditions, I realised, held lessons not just for us, but for society as a whole.
As I look to the future, I see my role not just as a preserver of tradition for my family, but as a bridge builder. I have the responsibility and the privilege of helping to carry the wisdom of our ancestors forward, adapting it for new generations and sharing it with the wider world. In doing so, I honour my father and all those who came before me in the truest sense.

To those who may be on a similar journey, grappling with questions of tradition, duty, and identity, I offer this: Don't be afraid to question, to doubt, to seek understanding. Our traditions are strong enough to withstand scrutiny. In fact, it's through this process of questioning and reinterpretation that they remain alive and relevant. Remember that honouring your ancestors isn't about maintaining a physical location or performing rituals without understanding. It's about carrying their spirit forward, embodying their wisdom in your life, and building upon the foundation they laid. Your ancestors live on through you—in your DNA, your values, your actions. You are their living legacy.
And to my father, whose death sparked this journey of discovery: Thank you. Your life, your teachings, and yes, even your death, have guided me to a deeper understanding of myself and our heritage. You are not confined to a grave in our old homestead. You are with me always, living on through me and the generations that will follow.
As I close this chapter of my life, I do so not with a sense of finality, but with an openness to continued growth and understanding. The journey doesn't end here. Our traditions, like life itself, are ever-evolving. And in that evolution, in the passing of wisdom from one generation to the next, in the constant reinterpretation and renewal of our heritage, our ancestors truly live on.

Umhlaba emhlabeni, uthuli eluthulini—earth to earth, dust to dust. But the spirit? The spirit is free, boundless, eternal. It lives in us, through us, and beyond us. And in understanding this, I have found my peace, my purpose, and my place in the great circle of life.

Preface: The Child's Compass Points the Way
In the heart of South Africa, a nation grappling with its complex past and the aspirations for its future, lies a principle with the power to transform the lives of its most vulnerable citizens: the best interests of the child. Enshrined in Section 28 of the South African Constitution, this principle should serve as a guiding light for all decisions and actions concerning children. Yet, three decades after the fall of apartheid, the promise of a "rainbow nation" built on equality and justice remains unfulfilled.
Well-intentioned redress policies have inadvertently created new challenges. State-sanctioned discrimination, even under the guise of "fair discrimination," has perpetuated inequality and exacerbated social ills. The "born-frees," who should have inherited a nation of equal opportunity, now face a country with more race and gender-based legislation than during apartheid, as reported by AfriForum. This generation, and their children, grapple with the consequences: failed public services, soaring unemployment rates, rampant crime, and a society plagued by numerous social issues.
This book argues that there is no policy decision that does not ultimately impact children. Whether it's employment equity legislation, economic policy, or social welfare programs, every decision reverberates through society and affects the lives of children. For instance, employment policies that discriminate against certain groups directly impact a parent's ability to provide for their children. Economic policies that disproportionately allocate funding affect the resources available for children's education, health, and well-being.
Section 28 of the Constitution asserts that a child's best interests are of paramount importance in every matter concerning the child. This book contends that every policy in the country ultimately concerns children, and as such, every policy decision should be subject to this provision. By adopting this perspective, we can create a society where every child is valued, protected, and empowered, regardless of their race, gender, or socioeconomic background.
The journey ahead is challenging. South Africa's history of apartheid and ongoing struggles with inequality have created deep-seated biases and systemic barriers that continue to affect children's lives. However, the best interests of the child principle provides a powerful framework for challenging these injustices and advocating for change.
This book is a call to action for all South Africans. It is for parents, caregivers, educators, social workers, activists, and anyone who believes in the power of the law to create a more just and equitable society. By understanding the best interests of the child principle and its potential to transform our nation, we can work together to build a brighter future for all.
In advocating for the superiority of the best interests of the child principle over redress provisions, this book emphasises the far-reaching impact of policy decisions on children. It argues that when state-sanctioned discrimination disadvantages a parent, it inherently disadvantages the child as well. From economic stability to access to opportunities, every policy decision shapes the environment in which children grow and develop.
By placing the best interests of the child at the forefront of all policy and legal decisions, we can build a society that truly values and invests in its future generations. This requires addressing the root causes of inequality, challenging discriminatory practices, and advocating for policies that prioritise the well-being of all children, regardless of their background.
As we embark on this exploration, we must ask ourselves: 
Can the best interests of the child principle serve as a powerful tool to challenge and dismantle state-sanctioned discrimination? 
Can it be a compass that guides us towards a future where all children have the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential? 
This book argues that the answer is a resounding yes, and invites all South Africans to join in the effort to create a more just and equitable society for our children and generations to come.


Part I: Historical Evolution of the Best Interests Principle
Ancient and Medieval Origins of Child Welfare
In our quest to understand the best interests of the child principle and its potential to reshape South African society, we must first journey back through time to explore the earliest conceptions of child welfare. This chapter examines how ancient civilizations and mediaeval societies approached the care and protection of children, laying the groundwork for modern child rights principles.

Early Conceptions of Child Welfare in Ancient Civilizations
While the concept of childhood as a distinct stage of life with inherent rights is a relatively modern development, ancient civilizations did recognize the importance of protecting and nurturing children. In many societies, children were viewed as blessings from the gods or ancestral spirits, and their well-being was seen as essential for the continuation of the family lineage and the prosperity of the community.
In ancient Egypt, for example, children were cherished and protected by law. The goddess Isis was revered as the divine mother and protector of children, and her image was often depicted in amulets and other objects associated with childbirth and child-rearing. The ancient Egyptians also had laws that prohibited infanticide and child abuse, and they recognized the importance of education and training for children.
In ancient Mesopotamia, the Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest known legal codes, included provisions for the care and upbringing of children. The code emphasised the responsibility of parents to provide for their offspring and outlined punishments for those who neglected or abused children.
In ancient Greece and Rome, philosophers and legal scholars recognized the importance of nurturing and educating children for the betterment of society. Plato, in his Republic, advocated for the education of both boys and girls, while Aristotle emphasised the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping an individual's character and potential.
In ancient China, Confucian philosophy emphasised filial piety, the respect and obedience owed to one's parents and ancestors. This principle extended to the care and upbringing of children, who were seen as the future of the family and society. Confucian teachings also stressed the importance of education and moral cultivation for children, emphasising the role of parents and teachers in shaping their character and values.

Mediaeval Developments in Child Welfare
The mediaeval period witnessed a complex interplay of religious, cultural, and legal influences on the understanding of child welfare. The rise of Christianity brought a renewed emphasis on the sanctity of life and the importance of protecting the vulnerable, including children. Religious institutions played a significant role in providing care and education for orphans and abandoned children, establishing a precedent for the state's responsibility in child protection.
In Europe, the mediaeval church established orphanages and foundling hospitals to care for abandoned children. These institutions, while often overcrowded and underfunded, provided a vital safety net for children who would otherwise have been left to fend for themselves. The church also played a role in regulating marriage and family life, emphasising the importance of parental responsibility for the care and upbringing of children.
In the Islamic world, the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad emphasised the importance of compassion and kindness towards children. Islamic law provided detailed guidelines for the care and upbringing of children, including their rights to inheritance, education, and protection from harm.
In Africa, traditional societies had their own approaches to child welfare, often rooted in communal values and practices. Children were seen as belonging to the community as a whole, and their upbringing was a shared responsibility. Elders played a crucial role in transmitting cultural knowledge and values to children, while the community as a whole provided support and protection.

The Xhosa Tradition of Child-Rearing: A Communal Tapestry of Nurturing and Resilience
The Xhosa people of southern Africa, like many other African cultures, have a rich tradition of child-rearing that emphasizes the importance of family, community, and cultural identity. Children are seen as gifts from the ancestors and are cherished and nurtured by their families and the wider community.
In traditional Xhosa society, child-rearing was a collective responsibility, with grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other relatives playing an active role in the upbringing of children. As I explored in my book, The Homeschooling Father, this communal approach was not only a cultural norm but a practical necessity in a society where resources were often scarce and families relied on each other for support. This shared responsibility fostered a strong sense of belonging and identity, as children learned their cultural traditions, values, and beliefs from multiple sources within their extended family and community.
The Xhosa also have specific rituals and practices that mark important milestones in a child's life, such as birth, naming ceremonies, initiation rites, and marriage. These rituals serve to reinforce the child's connection to their family, community, and ancestors, and to prepare them for their roles and responsibilities as adults. For instance, the imbeleko (welcoming ceremony for a newborn) celebrates the arrival of a new life and integrates the child into the community. Initiation rites like ulwaluko (circumcision for boys) and intonjane (initiation for girls) mark the transition to adulthood and impart important cultural knowledge and values.
These traditional practices, deeply rooted in the principles of ubuntu (interconnectedness and shared humanity), offer a holistic approach to child-rearing that prioritises the well-being and development of the child within the context of their family and community. This approach aligns with the best interests of the child principle, which emphasises the importance of considering the child's physical, emotional, psychological, and social needs in all decisions and actions concerning them.
However, it is important to note that the modern interpretation of "community" often differs significantly from the traditional Xhosa understanding. As discussed in The Homeschooling Father, the concept of community has been co-opted by some to justify the state's role in child-rearing and education, often at the expense of parental autonomy and cultural values. This modern interpretation of community, which emphasises the state's role over that of the family, can undermine the very essence of traditional child-rearing practices that prioritise the child's connection to their family, community, and cultural heritage.


The Clash with Colonial and Apartheid Systems
The arrival of European colonists in South Africa profoundly disrupted traditional child-rearing practices, imposing Western values and norms on African societies. Colonial and apartheid regimes implemented policies that systematically undermined the authority of traditional leaders and institutions, including those crucial for child welfare.
One of the most significant disruptions was the migrant labour system. This system compelled many Xhosa men from the Transkei to leave their families to work in mines and factories, often far from home. This separation destabilised traditional family structures and left women and children to cope with the absence of fathers. The support of the extended family was crucial; without it, many women would have faced the daunting challenge of raising children alone. However, the extended family could not fully compensate for the absence of fathers, who, due to dangerous working conditions, political violence, or other factors, often saw their children only sporadically, if at all. Tragically, many fathers never returned home, leaving children without parental guidance and support, especially those who did not have the benefit of father figures in the extended family.
The colonial legal system further eroded traditional child-rearing practices by imposing foreign legal doctrines that did not consider the cultural context of African families. Key among these were the maternal preference rule and the tender years doctrine, imported from English common law. These doctrines favoured mothers in custody disputes, often disregarding the traditional African understanding of child-rearing, which typically involved the broader community and extended family in caregiving roles.

The Influence of Religion and Philosophy
Religious and philosophical thought continued to influence the development of child welfare principles during the mediaeval period and beyond. The Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason and individual rights, led to a greater recognition of children as autonomous beings with their own needs and interests.
Philosophers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued for the importance of education and nurturing in child development. Locke's concept of the "tabula rasa" suggested that children are born as blank slates, and their experiences and environment shape their character and potential. Rousseau, in his book Emile, or On Education, advocated for a child-centred approach to education that respected the natural curiosity and developmental stages of children.
These philosophical ideas, along with the growing influence of humanitarian movements, led to the development of modern child welfare principles. The 20th century saw the emergence of international treaties and declarations, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which codified the best interests of the child principle as a fundamental human right.

A Path Forward: Beyond Redress
As we trace the origins of child welfare concepts through ancient and mediaeval times, we see the gradual emergence of ideas that would later inform the best interests of the child principle. From the legal protections in Hammurabi's Code to the communal child-rearing practices in African societies, these early approaches to child welfare laid the foundation for more comprehensive child rights frameworks.
However, it's crucial to note that many of these historical practices, while progressive for their time, still fell far short of modern standards of child protection and rights. The journey from these early conceptions to the robust child rights principles we advocate for in post-apartheid South Africa is long and complex.
In the following chapters, we will explore how these ancient and mediaeval ideas evolved into modern child welfare principles, and ultimately, how the best interests of the child concept can be leveraged to address the unique challenges facing South African children today. By understanding this historical context, we can better appreciate the significance of enshrining children's rights in our constitution and the potential for these rights to drive societal transformation, moving Beyond Redress towards a truly equitable future.



Part II: Traditional African Child-Rearing Practices
From Enlightenment to Modern Era - The Evolution of Child Rights
As we move from ancient and mediaeval concepts of child welfare to more modern interpretations, we witness a remarkable transformation in how society views children and their rights. This chapter explores the journey from the Enlightenment period to the present day, highlighting key developments that have shaped our current understanding of the best interests of the child principle.

The Enlightenment's Child: Reshaping Perceptions
The Enlightenment era brought about significant changes in how children were perceived. John Locke's concept of the child as a "blank slate" or "tabula rasa" revolutionised thinking about child development. However misguided this approach may have been, as demonstrated by Steven Pinker in his book The Blank Slate, this notion had profound implications for education and child-rearing practices. It emphasised the importance of nurturing and positive experiences during a child’s formative years.
Enlightenment thinkers laid the groundwork for recognizing children as individuals with unique needs and rights, rather than merely as small adults or property of their parents.
As these ideas spread, society began to push back against the exploitation of children. The concept of childhood as a distinct and valuable phase of life began to take hold, leading to early efforts to protect children from labour abuses and provide them with education.

Industrial Revolution and Its Aftermath
The Industrial Revolution highlighted the exploitation of children. As factories proliferated across Europe and North America, child labour became widespread. Children as young as 3 years old were employed in hazardous jobs, such as chimney sweeping. This profession, dominated by boys, exposed them to dangerous conditions that often led to severe health issues, including cancer, and sometimes resulted in workplace fatalities. Many children aged five or six endured long work hours in perilous environments, severely compromising their health and development. This grim reality catalysed reform movements and led to the introduction of the first factory acts, which began regulating child labour.
Alongside these labour reforms, a push for universal education gained momentum. Reformers argued that all children, regardless of social class, should have access to basic education. This led to the introduction of compulsory schooling laws in many countries, marking a significant step forward in recognizing the rights of children to education and protection from exploitation.
The 19th century also saw the emergence of child protection societies and early child welfare legislation. These organisations and laws aimed to safeguard children from abuse and neglect, reflecting a growing societal commitment to child welfare.

The 20th Century: Formalizing Child Rights
The horrors of World War I brought the vulnerability of children in conflict situations to the forefront of international concern. In 1924, the League of Nations, which was replaced by The United Nations after World War II adopted the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child, the first international document to recognize that children had specific rights. This declaration laid out five basic principles, including the right to proper development, both materially and spiritually.
World War II further underscored the need for international cooperation in protecting children. The post-war period saw an increased emphasis on children's psychological well-being, recognizing the deep trauma many had experienced during the conflict. This shift in focus would have lasting implications for how we understand child welfare.
In 1959, the United Nations adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, expanding on the principles laid out in the Geneva Declaration. This new declaration explicitly stated that the child's best interests should be a paramount consideration in all matters concerning children. It marked a significant step towards global recognition of children's rights and the best interests principle.

The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
The crowning achievement in the evolution of child rights came in 1989 with the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). This comprehensive treaty, ratified by all UN member states except the United States, set out a wide range of rights for children. It established four core principles: non-discrimination; devotion to the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival, and development; and respect for the views of the child.
The UNCRC went beyond previous declarations by creating mechanisms for implementation and monitoring. It established the Committee on the Rights of the Child to oversee progress and hold states accountable for their commitments to children's rights.

Further Developments in Child Rights in Africa, with a Focus on South Africa
Following the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in 1989, Africa made significant strides in advancing children's rights through regional instruments and national legislation. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC), adopted in 1990 and entering into force in 1999, stands out as a pivotal development in this regard.
South Africa has emerged as a leader in children's rights on the African continent, distinguishing itself through robust constitutional protections and progressive legislation. The country's approach to children's rights is characterized by:
Constitutional Enshrinement: South Africa's 1996 Constitution explicitly recognizes children's rights in Section 28, providing a strong legal foundation for child protection.
Comprehensive Legislation: The Children's Act of 2005 and the Child Justice Act of 2008 offer detailed frameworks for child welfare and juvenile justice, respectively.
Judicial Interpretation: South African courts have consistently applied the 'best interests of the child' principle, contributing to a rich body of case law that often serves as a reference for other African nations.
Ratification of International Instruments: South Africa has ratified both the UNCRC and the ACRWC, demonstrating its commitment to international child rights standards.
Innovative Programs: The country has implemented various child-focused initiatives, such as the Child Support Grant, which has significantly reduced child poverty.
While South Africa has made considerable progress, the situation across the rest of Africa varies:
Legislative Frameworks: Many African countries have enacted child rights legislation, but implementation often lags behind South Africa's more robust enforcement mechanisms.
Resource Allocation: South Africa generally allocates more resources to child-centric programs compared to many other African nations, which often face severe budgetary constraints.
Child Labor: While child labor remains a challenge in South Africa, particularly in agricultural settings, the country has made more progress in combating this issue compared to many other African nations where child labor in mining, agriculture, and informal sectors remains pervasive.
Education Access: South Africa has achieved near-universal primary education enrollment, outperforming many African countries where access to education remains a significant challenge.
Child Marriage: South Africa has stricter laws and enforcement against child marriage compared to several other African countries where the practice remains prevalent.
Child Soldiers: Unlike some conflict-affected African nations, South Africa does not face the issue of child soldiers, having signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict.

Challenges and Critiques in the Modern Era
Despite these advances, the implementation of child rights faces significant challenges. Debates around cultural relativism versus universal rights continue, as does the struggle to balance traditional practices with international standards. Many countries face resource constraints that hinder the full realisation of child rights.
New issues have also emerged, such as children's digital rights. These challenges require innovative approaches and a renewed commitment to putting children's best interests at the forefront of policy and decision-making.
As we conclude this journey from the Enlightenment to the modern era, we see how dramatically the concept of child rights and the best interests principle have evolved. While significant progress has been made in recognizing and protecting children's rights, much work remains. The next chapter will explore how these global developments have influenced and been influenced by South African perspectives on child welfare, setting the stage for our discussion on the role of the best interests principle in addressing contemporary challenges in post-apartheid South Africa.




Colonial and Early South African Context: Disrupting the Child's Compass
The arrival of European colonists in South Africa marked a turning point in the nation's history, bringing with it profound changes to the social, cultural, and legal landscape. This chapter delves into the colonial impact on child welfare, examining how Western legal systems and ideologies clashed with traditional African practices, ultimately disrupting the delicate balance that had long guided child-rearing in indigenous communities. We will also explore the early South African legal landscape, highlighting the policies and practices that shaped the treatment of children before the advent of significant legal reforms.

Colonial Impact on Child Welfare
The imposition of European legal systems and cultural norms on African societies had far-reaching consequences for child welfare. Colonial powers often viewed African customs and traditions as primitive or uncivilised, seeking to replace them with Western ideals and practices. This cultural imperialism extended to child-rearing, where traditional communal approaches were often undermined or dismissed in favour of European notions of family and childhood.
One of the most significant impacts of colonialism was the introduction of Western legal concepts of guardianship and parental rights. These concepts, rooted in individualistic values, often clashed with the communal child-rearing practices prevalent in many African societies. In traditional Xhosa culture, for example, children were seen as belonging to the community as a whole, and their upbringing was a shared responsibility among family members, elders, and the broader community. The imposition of Western legal frameworks, which emphasised the nuclear family and parental authority, disrupted these traditional structures and undermined the collective responsibility for child welfare.
Furthermore, colonial laws and policies often discriminated against indigenous children, denying them access to formal education, healthcare, and other essential services. The establishment of separate schools and healthcare facilities for white and black children entrenched racial segregation and inequality, hindering the development and well-being of African children.

Early South African Practices
The early South African legal landscape, shaped by colonial and apartheid policies, further exacerbated the challenges facing children. The legal system often reflected and reinforced societal biases and discriminatory practices, particularly against black children and children from marginalised communities.
The concept of the best interests of the child, while present in some legal frameworks, was often overshadowed by discriminatory laws and practices. For example, the "Black Administration Act" of 1927 gave white Native Commissioners broad powers over African children, often leading to their removal from their families and placement in institutions or foster care with white families.
The "Children's Act" of 1960, while introducing some protections for children, also contained provisions that discriminated against black children and reinforced the authority of the state over parental rights. The Act's focus on "European" norms and values further marginalised indigenous child-rearing practices and contributed to the erosion of cultural identity.

From Colonialism to Constitution
The colonial and early South African context provides a critical backdrop for understanding the challenges and complexities of upholding the best interests of the child principle in the country today. The clash between Western legal systems and traditional African practices, coupled with the legacy of discriminatory laws and policies, has created a unique and often challenging landscape for child welfare.
As we move forward, it is essential to recognize and address the historical injustices that have shaped the lives of South African children. By acknowledging the diversity of cultural practices and values, and by working towards a more inclusive and equitable legal framework, we can create a society where the best interests of all children are truly prioritised and protected.



Xhosa Child-Rearing Practices: A Communal Tapestry of Nurturing and Resilience
In the heart of the Transkei region of South Africa, the Xhosa people have cultivated a rich and intricate tapestry of child-rearing practices that reflect their deep-rooted cultural values, communal spirit, and reverence for ancestral wisdom. This chapter delves into the social structures, cultural norms, and child welfare practices that have shaped the upbringing of Xhosa children for generations. By examining these traditional practices and comparing them with Western legal principles, we can gain valuable insights into the diverse approaches to child-rearing and their implications for the best interests of the child.

Overview of Xhosa Society: Ubuntu and the Collective Spirit
Xhosa society is characterised by the philosophy of ubuntu, a concept that emphasises interconnectedness, community, and shared responsibility. This philosophy permeates all aspects of life, including child-rearing. Children are not seen as belonging solely to their parents but are considered a precious gift from the ancestors and a collective responsibility of the entire community.
The extended family plays a central role in Xhosa child-rearing. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other relatives actively participate in the upbringing of children, offering guidance, support, and cultural transmission. This communal approach fosters a strong sense of belonging, identity, and social cohesion, providing children with a network of caregivers who share a vested interest in their well-being.

Child Welfare Practices: Nurturing the Next Generation
Xhosa child-rearing practices are deeply rooted in tradition and cultural values. From infancy to adulthood, children are guided through various rites of passage and rituals that mark their development and prepare them for their roles and responsibilities within the community.
Early Childhood: Infants and young children are showered with affection and attention, often carried on their mothers' backs or held by other caregivers. This close physical contact fosters a strong emotional bond and a sense of security.
Naming Ceremonies: The naming of a child is a significant event in Xhosa culture, often involving the participation of elders and community members. The name given to a child reflects their ancestry, family history, and hopes for their future.
Storytelling and Oral Tradition: Storytelling plays a vital role in transmitting cultural knowledge, values, and history to children. Elders share folktales, proverbs, and historical narratives, instilling a sense of pride and identity in the younger generation.
Initiation Rites: As children reach adolescence, they undergo initiation rites that mark their transition to adulthood. These rites, such as ulwaluko (circumcision for boys) and intonjane (initiation for girls), are deeply symbolic and serve to teach important life lessons, values, and responsibilities.
Communal Education: Education in traditional Xhosa society was a continuous process of learning from elders, family members, and the community. Children learned practical skills, such as farming, animal husbandry, and crafts, and cultural traditions, social norms, and spiritual beliefs.

Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs. Western Approaches
The Xhosa approach to child-rearing, with its emphasis on communal care, cultural transmission, and holistic development, contrasts sharply with Western legal principles like the tender years doctrine and maternal preference. These Western principles, rooted in individualistic values and gender stereotypes, often prioritise the mother's role in child-rearing and can undermine the involvement of fathers and extended family members.
The tender years doctrine, which presumes that young children are best cared for by their mothers, is at odds with the Xhosa tradition of shared parenting, where multiple caregivers contribute to a child's upbringing. Similarly, the maternal preference rule, which favours mothers in custody disputes, can marginalise the role of fathers and other family members who play a vital role in the child's life.
While Western legal principles have evolved to recognize the importance of both parents in a child's life, the legacy of the tender years doctrine and maternal preference rule continues to influence judicial decisions and societal attitudes towards parenting. This can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings in cases involving Xhosa families, where the court's understanding of the child's best interests may not align with the cultural context and values of the community.
In contrast, the Xhosa approach to child-rearing aligns more closely with the holistic and child-centric approach advocated for by the best interests of the child principle. By recognizing the importance of family, community, and cultural identity in child development, the Xhosa tradition offers valuable insights into how to create a nurturing and supportive environment that fosters the well-being and potential of every child.


Traditional Child-Rearing Across African Tribes: A Tapestry of Shared Values and Diverse Practices
The tapestry of African cultures is rich and diverse, woven with threads of unique traditions, beliefs, and practices. Child-rearing, a cornerstone of any society, is no exception. This chapter explores the diverse child-rearing practices across various African tribes and communities, highlighting both the common threads that bind them and the unique expressions that reflect their distinct identities. By examining these practices, we can gain a deeper understanding of the values and beliefs that shape African childhoods and their relevance to the best interests of the child principle.

A Kaleidoscope of Traditions
Across the vast continent of Africa, child-rearing practices vary significantly, reflecting the unique cultural, social, and environmental contexts of different communities. From the nomadic pastoralists of the Sahel to the agricultural communities of the Great Lakes region, each tribe has developed its own customs and traditions for raising children.
Some common themes emerge across these diverse practices. The importance of family and community is a recurring motif, with children often raised in extended family networks that provide a sense of belonging, identity, and support. Elders play a crucial role in transmitting cultural knowledge, values, and traditions to younger generations, ensuring the continuity of cultural heritage.
However, there are also significant differences in child-rearing practices across different tribes. These differences can be seen in the roles and responsibilities assigned to children, the methods of discipline and guidance, and the rituals and ceremonies that mark important milestones in a child's life.
For example, among the Maasai of East Africa, children are expected to take on responsibilities such as herding livestock and assisting with household chores from a young age. This early involvement in family and community life fosters a sense of responsibility and self-reliance.
In contrast, among the Akan people of West Africa, children are often indulged and pampered, with a strong emphasis on emotional and spiritual well-being. This nurturing approach aims to cultivate a sense of empathy, compassion, and respect for others.

Commonalities and Differences
While the specific practices may differ, there are several common threads that run through traditional African child-rearing approaches. These include:
Communal Care: Children are raised in extended family networks, with multiple caregivers sharing the responsibility for their upbringing. This communal approach provides children with a sense of security, belonging, and support.
Cultural Transmission: Elders play a crucial role in transmitting cultural knowledge, values, and traditions to younger generations through storytelling, rituals, and everyday interactions. This ensures the continuity of cultural heritage and strengthens the child's sense of identity.
Holistic Development: Child-rearing is not just about physical care but also encompasses emotional, social, spiritual, and intellectual development. Children are encouraged to learn through experience, observation, and participation in community life.
Respect for Elders: Elders are revered for their wisdom and experience, and children are taught to respect and obey them. This respect for authority fosters discipline and social order within the community.
Connection to Nature: Many African cultures have a deep connection to nature, and children are taught to respect and appreciate the natural world. This connection fosters a sense of environmental stewardship and responsibility.
These common themes reflect a holistic and child-centric approach to child-rearing that prioritises the well-being and development of the child within the context of their family and community. This approach aligns with the best interests of the child principle, which emphasises the importance of considering the child's physical, emotional, psychological, and social needs in all decisions and actions concerning them.
However, there are also notable differences in child-rearing practices across different African tribes. These differences can be attributed to various factors, including geographical location, economic activities, social structures, and religious beliefs.
For example, nomadic pastoralist communities, such as the Maasai and the Fulani, tend to have more gender-segregated roles for children, with boys focusing on herding and girls on domestic chores. In contrast, agricultural communities, such as the Akan and the Yoruba, may have more flexible gender roles, with both boys and girls participating in farming and other activities.
The methods of discipline and guidance also vary across cultures. Some communities may use corporal punishment, while others rely on verbal reprimands, storytelling, or community sanctions to correct children's behaviour.

Comparing with Xhosa Practices
The Xhosa child-rearing practices discussed in the previous chapter share many similarities with those of other African tribes. The emphasis on communal care, cultural transmission, and holistic development is a common thread that runs through many African cultures.
However, there are also some unique aspects of Xhosa child-rearing that distinguish it from other traditions. For example, the Xhosa initiation rites, ulwaluko and intonjane, are particularly elaborate and play a central role in the transition from childhood to adulthood. These rites serve not only as a marker of maturity but also as a means of transmitting cultural knowledge, values, and social responsibilities.
The Xhosa tradition of ubuntu, with its emphasis on interconnectedness and shared responsibility, also has a profound impact on child-rearing practices. Children are raised to value community and to understand their role in contributing to the well-being of others. This communal ethos fosters a sense of empathy, compassion, and social responsibility that is essential for building a harmonious and equitable society.
By comparing Xhosa child-rearing practices with those of other African tribes, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity and richness of African cultures. We can also identify common themes and values that can inform our understanding of the best interests of the child principle and its application in the South African context.


Part III: The Best Interests of the Child in South African Law
The Legal Transformation: Embracing the Best Interests of the Child in South African Law
The dawn of democracy in South Africa in 1994 ushered in a transformative era for the nation's legal landscape, particularly in the realm of child welfare and protection. The newly adopted Constitution, a beacon of hope and progress, enshrined the principle of the best interests of the child as a fundamental cornerstone of the legal framework. This chapter explores the integration of this principle into South African law, examining its constitutional enshrinement and its profound implications for the rights and well-being of children.

Introduction to the Best Interests Principle in South Africa
The best interests of the child principle, a concept that had been evolving for centuries in various legal and cultural contexts, found a firm footing in South African law with the enactment of the 1994 Constitution. This principle, which prioritises the child's well-being in all matters concerning them, marked a significant departure from the previous legal framework that often favoured maternal rights and perpetuated gender stereotypes.
The inclusion of the best interests principle in the Constitution was a testament to the nation's commitment to protecting the rights of its most vulnerable citizens. It recognized that children are not merely passive recipients of care but are rights-holders with inherent dignity and agency. This principle, enshrined in Section 28 of the Bill of Rights, mandates that in all matters concerning children, their best interests shall be of paramount importance.

Constitutional Enshrinement: Section 28 and Its Significance
Section 28 of the Bill of Rights is a comprehensive and powerful provision that outlines a wide range of rights and protections for children. It encompasses their right to a name and nationality, family care or appropriate alternative care, basic nutrition, shelter, healthcare, and social services. It also protects children from maltreatment, neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
However, the most significant aspect of Section 28 is its unequivocal declaration that "a child's best interests are of paramount importance in every matter concerning the child." This principle serves as the guiding light for all decisions and actions that affect children, whether in the context of family law, child protection, education, or healthcare.
The constitutional enshrinement of the best interests principle has had a profound impact on the South African legal landscape. It has led to the development of new laws and policies that prioritise the well-being of children.
The principle has also influenced judicial decision-making, with courts increasingly applying a child-centric approach in cases involving custody, access, and other child-related matters. This has led to a greater recognition of the importance of both parents in a child's life, regardless of their gender or marital status, and a move away from the traditional maternal preference rule that favoured mothers in custody disputes.
The best interests of the child principle has also played a crucial role in challenging discriminatory practices and policies that harm children's well-being. For example, in the case of Goliath's Stand, the principle is being  used to argue against the discriminatory practices of the Children's Court, which often marginalised fathers and denied them equal parental rights.

The Best Interests of the Child and Equality Before the Law
The principle of the best interests of the child is not only a cornerstone of child protection but also aligns seamlessly with the fundamental principle of equality before the law. This alignment is crucial in ensuring that children's rights are upheld without discrimination based on gender or other factors.
Equality before the law, as enshrined in Section 9(1) of the Constitution, guarantees that all individuals are equal before the law and have the right to equal protection and benefit of the law. This principle prohibits unfair discrimination on various grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language, and birth.
In the context of child custody and care, the best interests of the child principle, in conjunction with the equality clause, mandates that courts cannot discriminate between parents based on their gender. This means that both mothers and fathers have equal rights and responsibilities towards their children, and decisions regarding custody, access, and care must be made solely based on what is in the best interests of the child, without any gender bias.
Furthermore, the best interests of the child principle requires a focus on the child's individual circumstances, taking into account their unique needs, preferences, and relationships with both parents. This individualised approach is consistent with the principle of equality before the law, as it ensures that each child is treated as a unique individual, rather than being subjected to generalisations or stereotypes based on their parents' gender.
This alignment between the best interests of the child principle and equality before the law has significant implications for challenging discriminatory practices and policies. For instance, broad-based policies like affirmative action, which prioritise certain groups based on race or gender, can be argued to be in conflict with both the best interests of the child and the principle of equality before the law. Such policies may inadvertently discriminate against children who do not fall within the designated groups, limiting their opportunities and potential based on factors beyond their control.
By upholding the best interests of the child principle and the principle of equality before the law, South Africa can create a legal and social environment that is truly fair and equitable for all children. This requires a commitment to dismantling discriminatory practices, promoting equal parenting rights, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their background or circumstances.



Pre-Constitutional Legal Principles: A Legacy of Gender Bias
Before the transformative 1994 Constitution, South African family law was heavily influenced by Western legal principles that often perpetuated gender stereotypes and inequalities. This chapter delves into two such principles—the tender years doctrine and the maternal preference principle—examining their history, application, and ultimate incompatibility with both traditional African practices and the constitutional guarantee of equality before the law.

The Tender Years Doctrine: A Presumption of Maternal Superiority
The tender years doctrine, a legal principle rooted in English common law, operated under the presumption that young children, particularly those of "tender years" (typically under the age of seven), were best cared for by their mothers. This doctrine stemmed from societal norms that viewed women as the primary caregivers and men as breadwinners. While seemingly benign, this doctrine had far-reaching consequences for child custody decisions, often resulting in fathers being marginalised and denied equal parental rights.
In South Africa, the tender years doctrine was adopted and applied in various forms throughout the 20th century. Courts often relied on this principle to award custody to mothers, even in cases where fathers were equally capable and willing to care for their children. This bias towards mothers not only perpetuated gender stereotypes but also disregarded the diverse family structures and child-rearing practices prevalent in many African cultures.

The Maternal Preference Principle: Reinforcing Gender Stereotypes
The maternal preference principle, closely related to the tender years doctrine, further reinforced the notion that mothers were the natural and preferred caregivers for young children. This principle was often invoked in custody disputes, where courts would prioritise the mother's claim to custody, even in the absence of evidence of her superior parenting abilities.
The maternal preference principle had a profound impact on the lives of fathers and children. Fathers were often relegated to the role of secondary caregivers, with limited access to their children and little say in their upbringing. This not only denied fathers their rightful role in their children's lives but also deprived children of the benefits of having a close and meaningful relationship with both parents.

Compatibility and Conflict: Traditional Practices vs. Western Principles
The tender years doctrine and maternal preference principle were not only discriminatory against fathers but also clashed with traditional African child-rearing practices. In many African cultures, child-rearing is a communal responsibility, with extended family members, including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and siblings, playing an active role in the upbringing of children.
The Xhosa tradition, for example, emphasises the importance of ubuntu, a philosophy of interconnectedness and shared responsibility. Children are seen as belonging to the community as a whole, and their upbringing is a collective effort. The imposition of Western legal principles that prioritised the mother's role undermined this communal approach and disrupted the traditional support systems that had long nurtured and protected children.

Incompatibility with Equality Before the Law
The tender years doctrine and maternal preference principle also contradicted the fundamental principle of equality before the law. By favouring mothers over fathers in custody disputes, these principles perpetuated gender stereotypes and denied fathers equal protection and benefit of the law.
The 1994 Constitution, with its emphasis on equality and non-discrimination, paved the way for dismantling these discriminatory principles. The constitutional enshrinement of the best interests of the child principle, which requires a holistic and individualised assessment of each child's needs and circumstances, further reinforced the need to move away from gender-based presumptions in child custody decisions.
Landmark court cases, such as Fraser v Children's Court, Pretoria North (1997) and M v M (2008), challenged and ultimately overturned the tender years doctrine and maternal preference principle. These rulings affirmed the importance of considering the child's best interests above all else, regardless of the parent's gender.
The rejection of these discriminatory principles marked a significant step towards achieving gender equality in family law and child welfare. It recognized that both mothers and fathers have an equal right and responsibility to care for their children, and that decisions regarding custody and access should be based on the child's individual needs and the capacity of each parent to provide for those needs.


Case Law and Judicial Interpretation
The best interests of the child principle, enshrined in Section 28 of the South African Constitution, has been a driving force in numerous landmark court cases that have shaped the landscape of child welfare and protection in the country. These cases have not only clarified the meaning and scope of the principle but also demonstrated its power to challenge discriminatory practices and promote the well-being of children.
S v M (2007): This case involved a dispute between a lesbian couple and the biological father of a child born through artificial insemination. The Constitutional Court held that the best interests of the child were paramount and that both the biological and social parents had a role to play in the child's life. This decision affirmed the importance of considering the child's relationship with all relevant caregivers, regardless of their sexual orientation or marital status.
Centre for Child Law v Minister of Social Development (2009): This case challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Children's Act that discriminated against children born out of wedlock. The Constitutional Court ruled that these provisions were unconstitutional as they violated children's rights to equality and dignity. This decision affirmed the principle that all children, regardless of their parents' marital status, are entitled to equal protection and benefit of the law.
FS v JJ and Others (2011): This case involved a dispute between a divorced couple over the relocation of their child. The Supreme Court of Appeal held that the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration in relocation cases, and that courts should consider a wide range of factors, including the child's views, the relationship between the child and each parent, and the impact of the relocation on the child's well-being.
JT v Road Accident Fund (2015): This case involved a claim for damages on behalf of a child who had been injured in a car accident. The Constitutional Court held that the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration in determining the amount of damages awarded, and that courts should consider the child's future needs, including medical expenses, rehabilitation, and loss of earning capacity.
These landmark cases demonstrate the transformative power of the best interests of the child principle in South African law. They have challenged discriminatory practices, expanded the scope of children's rights, and ensured that the child's well-being is prioritised in all legal decisions that affect them.

Judicial Trends: A Child-Centric Approach
The best interests of the child principle has not only influenced landmark court decisions but has also shaped broader judicial trends in South Africa. Courts are increasingly adopting a child-centric approach, recognizing children as active participants in their own lives and giving due consideration to their views and preferences.
This shift is evident in various areas of law, including:
Custody and Access Disputes: Courts are moving away from the traditional maternal preference rule and focusing on the individual needs and circumstances of each child. They are increasingly considering shared parenting arrangements and recognizing the importance of both parents in a child's life.
Child Protection Cases: Courts are prioritising the safety and well-being of children in cases of abuse, neglect, and exploitation. They are taking a more proactive approach to child protection, intervening early to prevent harm and ensuring that children receive the necessary support and services.
Adoption and Foster Care: Courts are placing greater emphasis on finding permanent, stable, and loving homes for children in need of care. They are also recognizing the importance of maintaining cultural and familial connections for children in alternative care.
These judicial trends reflect a growing recognition of the importance of the best interests of the child principle in all aspects of child welfare and protection. By adopting a child-centric approach, courts are not only upholding the rights of children but also contributing to the creation of a more just and equitable society for all.


Part IV: The Contemporary Application and Challenges
Legislative Reforms and State Spending
The best interests of the child principle has had a profound impact on South African legislation and state spending since its enshrinement in the Constitution. This chapter examines how this principle has shaped legislative reforms and influenced the allocation of government resources towards children's welfare.

Impact on Legislation
The best interests principle has been a driving force behind several significant legislative reforms in South Africa:
Children's Act 38 of 2005: This comprehensive legislation overhauled the legal framework for child protection in South Africa. It emphasises the best interests of the child in all matters concerning children, including adoption, foster care, and child custody.
Child Justice Act 75 of 2008: This act reformed the criminal justice system for children in conflict with the law, prioritising rehabilitation and reintegration over punitive measures.
South African Schools Act 84 of 1996 (as amended): Reforms to this act have focused on ensuring equal access to education and protecting children's rights within the school system.
Social Assistance Act 13 of 2004: This act provides for social grants, including the Child Support Grant, which has been crucial in supporting children from low-income families.
These legislative reforms demonstrate a clear shift towards a child-centric approach in South African law, with the best interests principle serving as a guiding framework.

State Spending and Resource Allocation
The South African government has established several entities dedicated to protecting children's interests and has allocated significant resources to support children's welfare:
Department of Social Development: Annual budget for 2021/2022 was approximately R205 billion, with a significant portion dedicated to child welfare services and grants.
Department of Basic Education: Annual budget for 2021/2022 was about R279 billion, focused on providing education and related services to children.
Office of the Rights of the Child (in the Presidency): While specific budget figures are not readily available, this office plays a crucial role in coordinating child rights policies across government departments.
South African Human Rights Commission: While not exclusively focused on children, it has a dedicated children's rights unit. Its total annual budget for 2021/2022 was approximately R189 million.
National Child Protection Committee: An inter-sectoral body coordinating child protection efforts, though specific budget allocations are not publicly detailed.

Spending on Parents
While precise figures are difficult to isolate, a stark disparity exists in government spending aimed at supporting mothers versus fathers as parents. This imbalance not only perpetuates gender stereotypes but also raises concerns about the equitable application of the best interests of the child principle.
Maternity Benefits: The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) provides maternity benefits for up to 17.32 weeks, with a substantial R1.6 billion disbursed in the 2020/2021 financial year.
Child Support Grant: Although accessible to both parents, this grant, amounting to R480 per month per child as of 2023, is predominantly claimed by mothers. In 2021/2022, a significant R71.3 billion was allocated to these grants.
Paternity Leave: While fathers are entitled to 10 days of paternity leave since 2019, paid through the UIF, the allocated budget and actual spending on this benefit are notably less than maternity benefits.
Father-Specific Programs: A glaring absence of government programs and dedicated spending specifically designed to support fathers in their parenting roles further underscores the systemic neglect of fathers' contributions to child-rearing.
This skewed allocation of resources not only reflects a disregard for fathers' roles in their children's lives but also raises questions about the state's commitment to upholding the best interests of the child. A child thrives best when nurtured and supported by both parents. By neglecting to invest in fathers, the government inadvertently undermines the well-being of children who are deprived of the full benefits of paternal involvement.
Furthermore, this disparity in spending can be seen as a form of indirect discrimination against children in families where fathers are the primary caregivers. When fathers lack access to the same resources and support as mothers, their ability to provide for their children's needs is compromised, ultimately affecting the children's overall well-being.
The lack of investment in fathers also perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes that can have long-term consequences for children's development. When boys grow up seeing their fathers marginalised and excluded from the parenting narrative, it can negatively impact their own understanding of fatherhood and masculinity.



Failures in Prioritising the Best Interests of the Child
The best interests of the child principle, enshrined in Section 28 of the South African Constitution, is a powerful mandate that should guide all decisions and actions affecting children. However, the prioritisation of redress policies and state-sanctioned discrimination has often led to unintended consequences that undermine this fundamental principle. This chapter examines how the pursuit of redress, while aiming to address historical injustices, has sometimes conflicted with the best interests of the child, resulting in real-world impacts on children's lives and well-being. It also explores the role of the High Court as the upper guardian of all children and its failure to adequately address discriminatory practices and laws that are not in the best interests of the child.

Redress Provision vs. Best Interests: A Conflict of Priorities
The redress provision in Section 9(2) of the Constitution allows for measures to promote equality and address past discrimination. However, the implementation of these measures, often in the form of affirmative action and Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies, has raised concerns about their compatibility with the best interests of the child principle.
While redress policies aim to create a more equitable society, they often rely on broad-based categorizations based on race or gender. This approach can overlook the individual needs and circumstances of children, leading to unintended consequences that may harm their well-being. For example, affirmative action policies in education and employment may limit opportunities for children from non-designated groups, regardless of their individual merit or potential.
Furthermore, the focus on redress can sometimes overshadow the importance of other factors that contribute to a child's well-being, such as stable family structures, access to quality education and healthcare, and a nurturing environment. By prioritising group-based redress over the individual needs of children, these policies may inadvertently perpetuate inequality and hinder the full realisation of the best interests of the child principle.

Real-World Impacts: The Born-Free Generation's Burden
The negative consequences of prioritising redress over the best interests of the child are evident in the experiences of the "born-free" generation, those born after the end of apartheid. Despite the promise of a more equitable society, this generation faces significant challenges, including high unemployment rates, rampant crime, and a lack of opportunities.
As highlighted in "The Unfairness of Fair Discrimination in South Africa," the burden of redress policies often falls disproportionately on the shoulders of the "born-frees." They are the ones who bear the brunt of affirmative action policies that limit their employment prospects and economic opportunities. They are also the ones who suffer from the unintended consequences of BEE policies, such as corruption and cronyism, which divert resources away from essential services like education and healthcare.
The high unemployment rate among the "born-frees" is a particularly alarming indicator of the failure of redress policies to create a truly equitable society. While these policies may have benefited a small elite within the designated groups, they have not translated into widespread economic empowerment for the majority of black South Africans.

The High Court's Role: A Failure of Guardianship?
The High Court, as the upper guardian of all children in South Africa, has a constitutional duty to protect their rights and ensure their well-being. However, the court's track record in addressing discriminatory practices and laws that are not in the best interests of the child has been mixed.
In some cases, the High Court has upheld the constitutionality of redress policies, even when they have been challenged on the grounds of discrimination. For example, in the case of Minister of Finance v Van Heerden (2004), the court upheld an affirmative action policy that provided more favourable pension benefits to black employees, despite arguments that it discriminated against white employees.
However, in other cases, the court has recognized the potential conflict between redress policies and the best interests of the child. In AB and Another v Minister of Social Development (2016), the court acknowledged the discriminatory impact of a law requiring a genetic link in surrogacy agreements, but ultimately upheld the law due to concerns about the child's right to know their genetic origins.
The High Court's reluctance to strike down discriminatory laws, even when they conflict with the best interests of the child, raises questions about its commitment to upholding this fundamental principle. The court's decisions often reflect a balancing act between competing rights and interests, but the prioritisation of redress over the well-being of children can have long-term consequences for their development and future prospects.
The High Court's failure to consistently and effectively challenge discriminatory practices and laws that harm children's interests is a significant concern. As the upper guardian of all children, the court has a responsibility to ensure that their rights are protected and that their well-being is prioritised in all legal and policy decisions. This requires a more proactive and assertive approach to judicial review, one that recognizes the potential harm caused by discriminatory policies and prioritises the best interests of the child above all else.


The Reality of the Born Frees
The "Born Free" generation, those born after the end of apartheid in 1994, were meant to inherit a South Africa free from the shackles of racial discrimination and inequality. This chapter examines the reality faced by this generation, analysing South Africa's progress and failures over the past three decades and how redress policies have shaped their opportunities and challenges.

Impact of Redress Policies on the Born Free Generation
Redress policies, while aimed at addressing historical injustices, have had mixed outcomes for the born free generation. Affirmative action, Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), and preferential procurement were designed to rectify racial inequalities across various sectors. These policies have led to increased representation of historically disadvantaged groups in certain sectors and corporate leadership roles, and improved access to higher education through bursaries and scholarships targeted at previously disadvantaged individuals. They have also supported the creation of black-owned businesses, providing opportunities for entrepreneurship among the born frees.
However, these policies have often benefited a small, connected elite rather than broadly improving opportunities for the majority of born frees. The intended economic redistribution has sometimes led to market distortions, creating dependencies and inefficiencies that undermine broader economic development. Moreover, affirmative action and preferential policies have generated perceptions of reverse discrimination, fostering tensions between different racial groups. Despite the focus on redress, significant poverty and unemployment persist, particularly among those not directly benefiting from these policies.
A pertinent example is affirmative action in higher education. Policies designed to increase the enrollment of historically disadvantaged students in universities have improved access for some but have also sparked debates about merit and equality. Many born frees feel these policies have not adequately addressed systemic issues in the education system, leading to a mismatch between qualifications and employment opportunities.

The Unintended Legacy: A Call for Objective Reassessment
The reality facing South Africa's Born Free generation starkly contrasts with the aspirations that heralded the end of apartheid. Far from inheriting a society of equal opportunity, many of these young South Africans find themselves trapped in a cycle of poverty and disadvantage, perpetuated by the very policies intended to address historical injustices.
The ripple effects of race and gender-based legislation have extended beyond the Born Frees themselves, impacting their children and, in some cases, even their grandchildren. This intergenerational burden is compounded by the economic strain placed on young South Africans who must support not only their own families but also their parents, many of whom were marginalised by discriminatory policies. The cruel irony is that these youth often struggle to meet their own basic needs, let alone those of their dependents.
Milton Friedman's wisdom resonates profoundly in this context: "One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results." After three decades of redress and affirmative action policies, it is imperative that we heed Friedman's advice. The time has come for an objective, clear-eyed assessment of these policies based on their outcomes, not their intended goals.
The data and experiences of the past 30 years provide ample evidence for such an evaluation. The persistent high unemployment rates, the widening wealth gap, and the ongoing struggles of the Born Free generation and their children all point to a troubling conclusion: in our quest to redress the injustices of the past, we have inadvertently compromised both the present and the future.
This is not to suggest that the goals of redress and equality are misguided. Rather, it is a recognition that the methods employed to achieve these goals have, in many cases, fallen short or produced unintended negative consequences. The continued use of racial classifications in policy-making, for instance, has perpetuated divisions and created new forms of exclusion, running counter to the vision of a non-racial society.
As we look to the future, it is crucial that we move beyond good intentions and focus on effective solutions. This may require a fundamental rethinking of our approach to addressing historical injustices. We must seek policies that promote genuine equality of opportunity without resorting to discriminatory practices that merely shift the burden of inequality from one group to another.
The Born Free generation, and indeed all South Africans, deserve a society that truly lives up to the promises of the post-apartheid era. This will require courage, creativity, and a willingness to challenge entrenched ideas. It will mean prioritising economic growth, education reform, and job creation over rigid quota systems. Most importantly, it will require a commitment to judging our progress not by the loftiness of our goals, but by the tangible improvements in the lives of all South Africans.
The path forward is challenging, but necessary. By learning from the unintended consequences of past policies and embracing a more nuanced, results-oriented approach, South Africa can begin to build a future that honours the sacrifices of the past while creating genuine opportunities for all its citizens, regardless of race or gender. The time for objective reassessment is now – the future of the Born Frees, their children, and the nation as a whole depends on it.


Part V: A Path Forward
Reforming Policy and Legal Frameworks
To truly champion the best interests of the child in post-apartheid South Africa, a comprehensive overhaul of existing policies and legal frameworks is imperative. The current landscape, marred by the unintended consequences of redress policies, necessitates a paradigm shift towards a more equitable and child-centric approach. This section outlines concrete recommendations for reform, emphasising the need to move beyond race and gender-based quotas and embrace a merit-based system that prioritises individual potential and the well-being of all children.

Merit-Based Approaches: A Path to True Equality
The pursuit of a truly equitable society requires a shift away from race and gender-based policies towards a merit-based approach that recognizes and rewards individual potential and achievement. By focusing on individual capabilities and contributions, rather than immutable characteristics, we can create a more just and inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to succeed based on their merit.
Merit-Based Education: Implement educational policies that prioritise merit and academic achievement, while also providing targeted support for disadvantaged students to ensure equal opportunities for all. This includes investing in quality education for all, regardless of socioeconomic background, and promoting a curriculum that equips students with the skills needed for the modern workforce.
Merit-Based Employment: Encourage employers to adopt merit-based hiring and promotion practices that focus on qualifications, skills, and experience, rather than race or gender. This would create a more competitive and dynamic workforce, where individuals are rewarded for their abilities and contributions, not their demographic characteristics.
Merit-Based Procurement: Reform public procurement policies to prioritise merit and value for money, rather than relying on preferential treatment based on race or gender. This would ensure that government contracts are awarded to the most qualified and capable bidders, promoting efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the use of public funds.

Recommendations for Reform
To truly champion the best interests of the child in democratic South Africa, a comprehensive overhaul of existing policies and legal frameworks is imperative. The current landscape, marred by the unintended consequences of redress policies, necessitates a paradigm shift towards a more equitable and child-centric approach. This section outlines concrete recommendations for reform, emphasising the need to move beyond race and gender-based quotas and embrace a merit-based system that prioritises individual potential and the well-being of all children.
Comprehensive Policy Review: To align national policies with the best interests of the child principle, it is crucial to undertake a thorough review of all existing policies and legislation. This can be achieved by establishing an independent commission tasked with scrutinising current frameworks through this critical lens. Such a commission would ensure that all policy decisions, past and present, prioritise the welfare of children. Furthermore, it should be mandated that all new policies undergo a "Child Impact Assessment" before they are implemented. This assessment would evaluate the potential effects of proposed policies on children, ensuring that their interests are safeguarded from the outset.
Education Reform: In the realm of education, there is an urgent need to shift focus from race-based admission policies to systems that support students based on their needs. This approach would involve eliminating all race- and gender-based discrimination as a criterion for eligibility, ensuring that education programs are accessible to all children, regardless of their background. Investment in teacher training and retention should be based on merit and performance, ensuring that educators are well-equipped and motivated to provide the best possible education. By concentrating resources on these areas, the education system can better serve all children and prepare them for a successful future.
Employment and Economic Policies: Employment and economic policies require a significant overhaul to address the limitations of current frameworks such as Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). Rather than broad-based racial quotas, there should be targeted interventions focused on skills development and supporting entrepreneurship. These measures would provide meaningful assistance to those most in need, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic economy. Additionally, youth employment initiatives should be designed to address individual needs rather than relying on demographic criteria. This shift would help bridge the gap between the current workforce and the job market’s demands, providing young people with the tools they need to succeed.
Social Welfare: Reforming the child grant system is essential to ensure that it effectively reaches all children in need, irrespective of their parents' race or gender. This reform would involve reassessing eligibility criteria and distribution mechanisms to eliminate biases and ensure equitable access. Comprehensive support programs for young parents should also be developed, focusing on their ability to care for their children rather than their demographic characteristics. Such programs would provide practical assistance and resources to help young parents succeed, contributing to better outcomes for their children.
Legal Framework: The legal framework governing children's welfare must be adjusted to prioritise the best interests of the child explicitly over redress considerations in all related matters. This adjustment would require amending the Children’s Act to reflect this priority clearly. In addition, family law reforms are necessary to ensure equal treatment of both parents in legal matters concerning their children. These reforms should focus on each parent's ability to provide care, rather than adhering to outdated gender stereotypes. By doing so, the legal system can promote a more balanced and fair approach to child welfare and parental responsibilities.
Implementing these recommendations will not only address the shortcomings of current policies but will also create a more equitable environment that prioritises the well-being and development of all children in South Africa.

The Best Interests of the Child: A Paramount Consideration in All Policy Decisions
The principle of the best interests of the child, as enshrined in Section 28 of the Constitution, should not be confined to family law and child protection matters. It should be the guiding principle in all policy decisions, as every decision made by the government ultimately affects children, whether directly or indirectly.
Policies that discriminate based on race or gender, such as affirmative action and BEE, can have unintended negative consequences for children. For example, when a parent is denied a job or business opportunity due to their race, it directly impacts their ability to provide for their children, thus hindering the child's development and future prospects.
By prioritising the best interests of the child in all policy decisions, we can ensure that every child has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their background. This means creating a level playing field where all children have equal access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. It also means dismantling discriminatory practices that perpetuate inequality and hamper social mobility.
The best interests of the child principle is not only a moral imperative but also a constitutional obligation. By upholding this principle, we can create a more just and equitable society for all South Africans, one where every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.




Empowering Courts and Legislators
The judiciary and legislature play crucial roles in safeguarding the best interests of the child. This chapter explores how these institutions can be empowered and reformed to ensure that the principle of the best interests of the child is consistently applied and prioritised over discriminatory policies.

Upholding the Best Interests of the Child as Upper Guardian
The High Court of South Africa, as the upper guardian of all children, bears a profound responsibility to ensure the well-being and protection of the nation's youth. This role extends beyond merely adjudicating individual cases; it encompasses a duty to actively safeguard the best interests of the child in all legal and policy matters. To fulfil this mandate, the High Court must adopt a proactive and vigilant approach, scrutinising legislation, policies, and practices that may directly or indirectly impact children's lives.
One of the key ways the High Court can exercise its guardianship is through judicial review. This involves assessing the constitutionality of laws and policies, ensuring they align with the principles enshrined in the Bill of Rights, particularly Section 28, which prioritises the best interests of the child. By striking down or amending discriminatory laws, such as those that perpetuate gender bias in child custody cases, the High Court can create a legal framework that truly reflects the values of equality and justice for all children.
Furthermore, the High Court can play an active role in shaping jurisprudence by interpreting and applying the best interests of the child principle in a manner that is consistent with the evolving needs and realities of South African society. This includes recognizing the diversity of family structures, promoting equal parental responsibility, and challenging discriminatory practices that undermine the well-being of children.
The High Court can also leverage its position as the upper guardian to issue guidelines and directives to lower courts, government agencies, and other stakeholders involved in child welfare. These guidelines can help ensure that the best interests of the child are consistently prioritised in all decisions and actions affecting children, from custody disputes to the allocation of resources for education and healthcare.

Role of the Judiciary
Holding the High Court Accountable as Upper Guardian:
Conduct a comprehensive review of the High Court's performance in upholding its role as the upper guardian of all children.
Ensure the High Court actively identifies legislation and actions by the government, private entities, and individuals that are not in the best interests of the child.
Mandate regular reports from government departments on the implementation of child-centric policies.
Require the High Court to report on programs implemented to fulfil its role as an upper guardian and provide regular progress reports.
Judicial Review of Policies:
Expand the scope of judicial review to include a "best interests of the child" test for all policies, even those not directly aimed at children.
Develop clear judicial guidelines for applying the best interests principle in cases involving conflicting rights or policies.
Training and Capacity Building:
Implement mandatory training for judges on child rights, child psychology, and the long-term impacts of policies on child welfare.
Establish a panel of expert advisors (child psychologists, educationists, social workers) to assist courts in complex cases involving children.
Precedent Setting:
Encourage courts to set strong precedents that prioritise children's interests over discriminatory policies or practices.
Develop a body of case law that interprets the best interests principle broadly, considering long-term and indirect impacts on children.
Enforcement Powers:
Grant courts enhanced powers to monitor and enforce compliance with judgments related to children's welfare.
Establish mechanisms for courts to impose sanctions on government departments that fail to implement child-centric policies effectively.
Public Interest Litigation:
Encourage and facilitate public interest litigation on behalf of children's rights.
Establish a dedicated fund to support legal challenges that seek to uphold the best interests of children.
Intersectional Approach:
Mandate that courts consider the intersectional impacts of policies on children, recognizing that factors like race, gender, and socioeconomic status often interact in complex ways.

Empowering Courts to Prioritise Best Interests over Discriminatory Policies
Constitutional Interpretation:
Develop a jurisprudence that interprets Section 28 (best interests of the child) as having primacy over other constitutional provisions when they conflict.
Encourage courts to adopt a "child-first" approach in constitutional interpretation.
Burden of Proof:
Shift the burden of proof to the state or parties defending potentially discriminatory policies to demonstrate that these policies do not harm children's interests.
Remedial Powers:
Expand courts' remedial powers to include the ability to strike down or modify policies that discriminate against children, even if indirectly.
Empower courts to order specific remedies, such as policy reformulation or budget reallocation, to better serve children's interests.
Standing and Access:
Broaden rules of standing to allow child advocates, NGOs, and concerned citizens to bring cases on behalf of children more easily.
Implement child-friendly court procedures to ensure children's voices are heard in matters affecting them.
Judicial Activism:
Encourage a form of judicial activism that proactively seeks to protect and promote children's rights.
Empower judges to call for evidence or expert opinions on the potential impacts of policies on children, even when not explicitly presented by the parties.

Legislative Changes
Best Interests of the Child Act:
Propose a comprehensive act that codifies the best interests principle and mandates its application across all areas of law and policy.
Include provisions that require all legislation to undergo a "child impact assessment" before enactment.
Amendment to the Equality Act:
Modify the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act to explicitly recognize the primacy of children's interests in cases of apparent conflict with other equality provisions.
Children's Rights Ombudsman:
Establish an independent Children's Rights Ombudsman with the power to investigate, report on, and challenge policies that negatively impact children.
Policy Impact Assessment Act:
Enact legislation requiring all government departments to conduct and publish child impact assessments for all major policy decisions.
Equality Before the Law Enhancement Act:
Propose legislation that reinforces the principle of equality before the law, with specific provisions to protect children from both direct and indirect discrimination.
Child-Centric Budgeting Act:
Enact a law requiring a certain percentage of the national budget to be allocated specifically to programs that directly benefit children.
Mandate transparency and accountability in using these funds.
Education Equality Act:
Propose legislation that focuses on equalising educational opportunities based on individual need rather than demographic factors.
Family Law Reform:
Amend family law statutes to prioritise the best interests of the child in all custody, maintenance, and family-related decisions.
Remove gender biases in family law, focusing instead on each parent's ability to meet the child's needs.

Conclusion
Empowering courts and legislators to prioritise the best interests of the child is crucial for creating a more equitable and child-centric society. By expanding the role of the judiciary as upper guardian, enhancing courts' ability to challenge discriminatory policies, and enacting comprehensive legislative changes, South Africa can move towards a legal framework that truly puts children first.
This approach requires a paradigm shift in how we view and implement laws and policies. It calls for courage from the judiciary to actively interpret the law in favour of children's interests and foresight from legislators to create a legal framework that prioritises the long-term well-being of the nation's youth.
Ultimately, by empowering these key institutions to champion the best interests of the child, we can create a society where every child, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to thrive and contribute to South Africa's future. This not only serves the interests of children but also lays the foundation for a more just, equitable, and prosperous nation for all.



A Vision for the Future
The best interests of the child principle offers a powerful path towards creating a more just and equitable society in South Africa. By prioritising this principle in all decision-making processes, we can address the root causes of inequality and discrimination that have persisted despite decades of redress efforts.
It was through enforcing my own constitutional rights in the children's courts, which continue to discriminate against fathers, that I realised the principle of the best interests of the child has the potential to challenge not only discrimination in children's courts but all discriminatory policies derived from the constitution, especially under the redress provision. While pursuing my own cause, I realised my struggle could help others, which is why I share it in my books. It's easy to feel despondent or give up in the face of South Africa's challenges, but we cannot afford to because these issues impact not only our present lives but also the future of our children.
Over the years, we have surrendered our authority and power as individuals to specialists, politicians, and other surrogates, believing they would act in our best interests. Now, we are paying the price, as our beautiful country is a shadow of its potential, with the born-free generation suffering the most. While specialists, politicians, and other surrogates have their place, it does not absolve us of our responsibility as individual citizens because we ultimately bear the cost of their decisions. It is important to realise that we all have the power to challenge any constitutional breach, thanks to the principle of equality before the law.
When we place children's welfare at the forefront, we naturally shift our focus from short-term political gains to long-term societal benefits. This approach encourages policies that invest in education, healthcare, and social support systems that benefit all children, regardless of their racial or socioeconomic background. By ensuring that every child has access to quality education and opportunities for personal growth, we lay the foundation for a more equitable society in the future.
Moreover, embracing the best interests of the child principle challenges us to move beyond the limitations of race-based policies. Instead of perpetuating divisions based on historical categories, we can focus on addressing the specific needs of each child. This individualised approach recognizes that children from all backgrounds may face unique challenges and ensures that support is provided based on need rather than demographic factors.
By prioritising children's interests, we also create a society that values potential over privilege. This shift can lead to a more meritocratic system where success is determined by individual ability and effort rather than inherited advantages or disadvantages. In turn, this can foster greater social mobility and reduce entrenched inequalities over time.

Call to Action
The path to a more equitable society begins with active citizenship. Every South African has the power and responsibility to challenge discriminatory laws and policies that undermine children's welfare. As outlined in "Goliath's Reckoning," tools like the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) provide accessible means for citizens to hold institutions accountable and advocate for change.
We call upon all citizens to:
Educate themselves about children's rights and the best interests principle.
Use PAIA and other legal tools to request information about policies affecting children.
Engage with local representatives and policymakers to advocate for child-centric reforms.
Support organisations working to protect children's rights and promote equality.
To policymakers and legal professionals, we urge a commitment to reforms that prioritise children's welfare and individual merit. This includes:
Reviewing and amending existing laws to ensure they align with the best interests principle.
Developing new policies focused on addressing children's needs rather than demographic quotas.
Implementing training programs on children's rights and the best interests principle for all professionals working with children.
Creating mechanisms for children's voices to be heard in policy-making processes.
For society as a whole, we encourage a shift in perspective that recognizes every child as a valuable member of our community, deserving of equal opportunities and protection. This involves:
Challenging our own biases and preconceptions about race, gender, and social status.
Fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect in our homes, schools, and communities.
Supporting initiatives that promote cross-cultural understanding and cooperation among children.
Valuing and nurturing the potential of every child, regardless of their background.

Key Points
Throughout this book, we have examined the complex interplay between South Africa's redress policies and the principle of the best interests of the child. We have argued that:
The current approach to redress, while well-intentioned, has often perpetuated inequality and discrimination.
The best interests of the child principle, as enshrined in the Constitution, offers a more effective framework for achieving true equity.
All policies, even those not directly aimed at children, ultimately impact their lives and should be evaluated through this lens.
A shift towards merit-based approaches and individual assessment can better serve children's needs than broad demographic categorizations.
The judiciary, particularly the High Court as upper guardian, has a crucial role to play in upholding children's rights and challenging discriminatory practices.

The Road Ahead
As we look to the future, the importance of the best interests principle in shaping a fair and equitable South Africa cannot be overstated. This principle offers a unifying vision that transcends racial and political divides, focusing instead on our shared commitment to the next generation.
By consistently applying this principle, we can create a society where every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential. This not only serves the interests of individual children but also strengthens the fabric of our nation, fostering social cohesion, economic growth, and democratic stability.
The road ahead will not be easy. It requires us to confront uncomfortable truths about the limitations of our current approaches and to make difficult choices that may challenge entrenched interests. However, the potential rewards – a truly equitable society where every child can thrive – make this journey not just worthwhile, but essential.

Commitment to Change
As we conclude this exploration, we call for an ongoing commitment to reform discriminatory practices and promote the welfare of all children. This is not a task that can be completed overnight, nor is it the responsibility of any single group or institution. It requires sustained effort from all sectors of society – government, civil society, communities, and individuals.
We must remain vigilant in identifying and challenging practices that undermine children's interests, even when they come cloaked in the language of redress or equality. We must be willing to engage in difficult conversations about race, privilege, and opportunity, always keeping the welfare of children at the centre of these discussions.
Most importantly, we must never lose sight of the transformative power of prioritising children's interests. By committing to this principle, we invest not just in individual children, but in the future of our nation. Every child whose potential is nurtured, every young mind that is empowered, brings us one step closer to the just and equitable society we all aspire to create.
The choice before us is clear. We can continue down the path of division and demographic categorization, or we can embrace a future where every child is valued, protected, and given the opportunity to succeed. By choosing the latter, we honour the spirit of our Constitution and the dreams of those who fought for a free and equal South Africa. The journey towards this vision begins anew with each child, each decision, and each commitment we make to prioritise their best interests above all else.

Modern, Broke, and Confused: 
A Beginner’s Guide to Progress

“The Khoisan and  Bantu were told to trade their animal skins for top hats and wool coats in the sweltering African sun, all in the name of sophistication. 
Instead, they got sweaty armpits and heatstroke, proving that "progress" sometimes just means being uncomfortable in style."

Prologue: Modern, Broke, and Confused: A Beginner’s Guide to Progress

Once upon a time—before electricity, taxes, and the glorious invention of the queue at Home Affairs—Africans lived in close-knit communities, raised their children together, and didn’t spend half their lives paying off a house they’ll finish owning at 70, just in time to die.
Then the Europeans arrived.
And they took one long, horrified look at everything and said:
🚨 “No, no, no—I don’t like that.” 🚨
They saw our clothing (or lack thereof) and decided we needed to sweat in three-piece suits in the African heat.
They saw our spiritual beliefs and decided we needed to fear hell more than we feared droughts.
They saw our self-sufficient family structures and decided we needed something called "nuclear families," where parents and children live alone, unsupported, and eventually die in nursing homes.
They saw our perfectly functional communal way of life and decided we needed something called "progress."
Fast-forward a few centuries, and here we are.
We have Western-style democracy—but the people we vote for are usually just looting enthusiasts with good PR.
We have formal education—but half the people graduating can’t find jobs, and the other half are drowning in student debt.
We have "free" healthcare—except it’s only free if you don’t mind waiting six months for an appointment.
We have infrastructure—except the roads are crumbling, the trains are missing, and Eskom thinks electricity is a part-time service.
This, my friends, is the Progress Paradox.
They told us that modernity would fix everything.
Instead, we got corruption, crime, and a government that collects more taxes than it delivers services.

But Let’s Be Fair—Not Everything Is Bad
Now, before you accuse me of being anti-modernization, relax—I love my WiFi and hot showers as much as the next person.
Some good came with colonization and industrialization.

Electricity? Great! (Except for the part where we can’t always rely on it.)
Medicine? Life-saving! (Though sometimes, you leave the clinic sicker than when you arrived.)
Technology? Game-changing! (Though now, half of it is wasted on TikTok challenges and misinformation, whatever that is.)

But we must also acknowledge what was lost.

We lost self-sufficiency—now we beg the government for things our ancestors provided for themselves.
We lost strong family structures—now therapists replace elders, and wisdom is something you have to pay for.
We lost cultural identity—now some of us know Shakespeare better than we know our own history.

Worst of all?
We got so attached to these systems that we now defend them—even when they fail us.

A Journey Through the Madness of “Progress”
This book isn’t a history lesson—it’s a satirical deep dive into how we ended up here.

We’ll explore how the Khoi and San met the Bantu, and how the Xhosa, Zulu, and other African groups encountered the Western colonizers—leading to a history that’s equal parts fascinating and infuriating.

We’ll look at how we went from practical, climate-friendly clothing to sweating in suits for professionalism.
We’ll laugh (and cry) about how informal education—rooted in real-world skills—was replaced by a rigid school system that produces more debt than jobs.
We’ll unpack how marriage customs evolved—and how modernity left more women raising children alone.
We’ll examine laws that were supposed to bring order but instead created chaos, crime, and inequality.

And when we’re done? We’ll move on to Book Two: Civilized, Struggling, and Still Confused: The Side Effects of Progress, where we’ll unpack the joys of democracy (which works best if you don’t ask too many questions), the great tax scam, and why crime remains the only sector with reliable job growth.

Who Should Read This Book?
This book is for everyone who has ever wondered:
“Wait… are we actually better off now than before?”
“Why do people who work hard get taxed the most, while those who loot get government contracts?”
“Why are we still wearing suits in Africa while Europeans now walk around barely clothed?”
“If progress is real, why do things feel worse?”
If you enjoy dark humor, historical irony, and brutally honest discussions about African history and modernity, then you’re in the right place.

Final Thought: Progress Isn’t Always Forward
The West told us they were bringing us progress.
But if progress means broken families, a collapsing economy, rising crime, and a government that steals more than the criminals—then maybe we need to rethink what progress actually means.
So grab a drink, settle in, and let’s take a journey through Modern, Broke, and Confused: A Beginner’s Guide to Progress.
You’ll laugh. You’ll think. You might even get a little angry.
But most importantly—you’ll never look at “progress” the same way again.








Part 1
Chapter 1: How My Ancestors Met My Other Ancestors and Things Got… Complicated
Long before colonialism, Youtube, and Eskom’s load-shedding schedule—before land debates, identity crises, and Twitter arguments—there were two great migrations shaping Southern Africa: the Khoisan, already here, living in harmony with nature, and the Bantu, moving southward with their cattle, iron, and big ideas.
The story of South Africa doesn’t start with Europeans lost at sea—it starts with these two groups, meeting for the first time, and trying to figure out whether they were going to be best friends, uneasy neighbors, or lifelong rivals.

The Khoisan: The First South Africans
Before the Bantu arrived, the Khoisan had already cracked the survival game. They lived off the land, moving with the seasons, never worrying about property taxes or municipal bills.
The San were master hunters and gatherers, tracking animals with skills that made modern GPS look embarrassing.
The Khoi were herders, tending cattle and trading with neighboring communities.
They didn’t have kings or chiefs; leadership wasn’t about power, but wisdom—if you had the best advice (or the best aim with a bow and arrow), you were respected.
Their philosophy was simple: Why “own” land when you can share it? Why hoard wealth when generosity ensured survival? Why create written laws when everyone knew that stealing someone’s antelope was just plain wrong?
For thousands of years, this worked. And then, from the north, a new wave of people arrived.

The Bantu Migration: Cattle, Iron, and a Different Way of Doing Things
The Bantu weren’t just travelers; they were revolutionaries in agriculture, metallurgy, and social organization. Their journey from Central Africa was one of the greatest human migrations in history, driven by the search for fertile land and resources.
They brought: 
Iron tools – because farming with sharpened bones is fun, but plows make life easier. 
Cattle – wealth on four legs, providing milk, meat, and status. 
Hierarchical societies – where leadership wasn’t just about advice, but also about control.
By the time they reached Southern Africa, the Bantu had already established farming communities, built kingdoms, and refined the art of accumulating wealth. Cattle were their currency, power was centralized, and land was something you owned—not something you borrowed from nature.
Now, if this were a Hollywood movie, the Khoisan and Bantu would have seen each other across the plains, exchanged cultural pleasantries, and immediately formed a united society.
But this was Africa.

A Clash of Worldviews: Trade, Marriage, and a Few Cattle Raids
Whenever two cultures meet, history offers three likely scenarios: 
They ignore each other (which wasn’t going to happen—cattle tend to wander). 
They trade and exchange ideas (which they did, with the Khoisan sharing their survival skills and the Bantu introducing iron tools). 
They fight (because, well... humans and land disputes go way back).
Some Khoisan resisted the Bantu’s expansion, leading to conflicts over grazing lands, water sources, and, most importantly, cattle—the original South African gold. Others intermarried, blending customs and languages. This fusion gave rise to the Xhosa people, whose language still carries the Khoisan influence through distinctive click sounds.
Some Khoisan simply moved elsewhere, following their nomadic instincts rather than engaging in endless disputes over whose cattle were grazing on whose land.
The Bantu, however, were there to stay.

Cattle, Kinship, and the Early Economic System
One of the biggest cultural differences between the Bantu and Khoisan was their relationship with property.
The Khoisan believed in sharing—food, land, and wisdom. If you had a good hunting day, you shared, knowing that luck might favor someone else tomorrow.
The Bantu believed in ownership—land was to be claimed, cattle were personal wealth, and power was centralized in leaders who made decisions for the entire community.
Naturally, this led to some awkward conversations: Khoisan: “How can you own cows? They are living creatures!”
 Bantu: “Yes, and they’re MY living creatures.”
Cattle raids became a part-time activity for some, a full-scale tradition for others. The Bantu saw raiding as a test of bravery and skill; the Khoisan saw it as outright theft.
But despite their differences, these two groups learned from each other:
The Khoisan adopted some cattle-herding techniques, realizing that fresh milk was better than chasing an antelope every day. 
The Bantu picked up Khoisan survival skills, learning the secrets of the land, the stars, and natural medicine.
In the end, both cultures influenced each other, blending into the South African identity we know today.

What Can We Learn From This?
✅ South Africa was always diverse. If you think cultural clashes started with colonialism, think again. The Khoisan and Bantu were debating land rights long before Europeans arrived.
✅ People will always fight over resources. Whether it’s cattle, land, or oil reserves, humans have a long history of saying, “That belongs to me,” and the other side responding, “No, it doesn’t.”
✅ Our history is a mix of conflict and cooperation. Without the Bantu expansion, the Khoisan might have lived in isolation. Without Khoisan resilience, Southern Africa might have looked very different.
We are here because of both.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🌍 Native Americans & European Settlers – They had their own land, their own way of life, and then—ships. You can guess how that went.
🇦🇺 Aboriginal Australians & British Colonists – Like the Khoisan, they lived sustainably for thousands of years—until “progress” (and some questionable decisions) arrived.
🇮🇳 India & Caste Systems – While the Bantu had chiefs and cattle wealth, India had kings and ancient social hierarchies. Both systems lasted for centuries and shaped identities in complex ways.

A Story of Adaptation, Not Erasure
The Khoisan and Bantu didn’t just collide—they adapted. Some fought, some traded, some blended. This wasn’t the end of one people and the rise of another; it was the birth of something new.
And just when they were settling into this uneasy coexistence, new visitors arrived.
Big wooden ships. Strange pale men. And wool coats in the African heat.
But that’s a story for the next chapter.

Chapter 2: How the Dutch Got Lost, the British Got Greedy, and the Xhosa Got... Involved in Everything

Imagine this: You’re living your best life—herding cattle, telling stories by the fire, and enjoying a world where nobody has ever asked you to fill out a tax form.
Then, one day, strange floating objects appear on the horizon.
Not canoes. Not fishing boats. No, these are giant wooden monsters, carrying pale people in strange clothes who look lost but very confident at the same time.
Congratulations, Southern Africa! Your first Europeans have arrived.
And with them, came a whole new era of trade, confusion, conflict, alliances, misunderstandings, and eventually—bureaucracy.

The Dutch: Looking for Spices, Finding Land Instead
It all started with the Dutch. To be fair, they weren’t trying to colonize Africa (at first). They were just looking for a shortcut to India, because back then, everyone wanted spices—not for fancy cooking, but because food preservation was a struggle.
So, the Dutch East India Company sent Jan van Riebeeck to set up a refreshment station at the Cape—a kind of medieval drive-thru for sailors to pick up fresh food and water before continuing their journey.
But—as history has taught us—when people say they’re “just passing through,” they usually end up staying.
What started as a pit stop turned into a settlement, and that’s when things got interesting.

The Khoisan & Bantu Meet the Dutch: A Mixed Reception
The Khoisan and Bantu, who had been doing just fine without Dutch involvement, were not sure what to make of these new visitors.
On one hand, the Dutch brought useful trade goods—metal tools, beads, and fancy clothing (even though wearing thick wool in Africa made no sense).
On the other hand, the Dutch didn’t seem to understand the local way of doing things.
For example: 
✅ The Khoisan didn’t 'own' land—they moved around, following the seasons. The Dutch saw open space and thought, “We’ll take that.” 
✅ The Bantu saw cattle as wealth, but also as a shared resource. The Dutch saw them as steaks on legs. 
✅ The natives thought treaties were agreements based on trust. The Dutch thought treaties were legal documents that gave them permanent rights.
It wasn’t long before cultural misunderstandings turned into actual conflicts.

The Land & Private Property Disputes Begin
The Dutch believed in official land deeds, contracts, and fences. The Xhosa believed in cattle wealth, oral agreements, and the simple logic of ‘Into yomntu yeyam, eyomlungu ndiyayifanisa.’ In other words, private property was a flexible concept—depending on who owned it.The Khoisan, on the other hand, believed no one owned land at all. And thus, the great property debates of South Africa began—a dispute so fierce that centuries later, it would still be shaping policies, protests, and dinner table arguments.
To the Xhosa, cattle weren’t just wealth; they were walking bank accounts, passed through generations, traded for marriage, or simply taken in daring raids. The Dutch, however, saw ownership as permanent—land, cattle, and property could be fenced, registered, and inherited according to strict legal codes. The Khoisan, watching this unfold, probably wondered why everyone was getting so worked up over resources that belonged to no one and everyone at the same time.
With each passing year, the Dutch expanded their settlements, pushing the indigenous people further from their ancestral grazing lands. What started as a few farms along the Cape soon turned into frontier wars, cattle raids, and a never-ending argument over who actually owned what.
And as history would have it, the British were about to arrive and make everything even more complicated.

The Afrikaners: A New African Tribe is Born
While the Dutch were busy running their trading post, something else was happening—their descendants were becoming something entirely new.
The Afrikaners (Boers) were not just European settlers anymore. They were farmers, fighters, and in many ways, a new African tribe.
They adapted to local conditions, developed their own language (Afrikaans), and started moving further inland, away from Dutch control.
They lived off the land, just like many African groups, but with a rigid belief in their own distinct identity.
And when the British eventually arrived, they found themselves caught between two worlds—not quite European anymore, but not fully African either.
This was just the beginning.

The British Arrive: Enter the Redcoats
Just as the Dutch and Afrikaners were settling in, along came the British, who looked at the Cape and thought, “That’s nice. We’ll take it.”
The British were not the 'live off the land' type—they were the 'rule from an office' type.
They introduced new laws, new taxes, and a lot of unrequested bureaucracy.
The Afrikaners resented British rule, so they started moving inland—the beginning of the Great Trek.
The Xhosa, meanwhile, were already dealing with both Dutch and British expansion, and their resistance would shape the coming conflicts.
And that’s when things really started to escalate.

The Xhosa: Caught in the Middle, But Always Standing Strong
The Xhosa were not passive bystanders in this unfolding drama.
They traded with the British, fought the British, and sometimes made peace with them.
They negotiated with the Afrikaners, fought the Afrikaners, and sometimes even aligned with them against the British.
They protected their land fiercely, sometimes through diplomacy, sometimes through war, but always with resilience and strategy.
South African history isn’t just a European story.
It’s a Xhosa story, an Afrikaner story, a Khoisan story, and a Bantu story—all colliding in ways that shaped the country’s future.

What Can We Learn From This?
✅ Nobody planned for things to turn out this way.
The Dutch just wanted a trading post.
The Khoisan just wanted their freedom to roam the land.
The British wanted control but ended up with a resistance movement.
The Xhosa wanted to keep their land and autonomy.
The Afrikaners wanted their own identity and independence.
✅ History is complicated.
The first interactions weren’t just wars—they were also trade, cooperation, and alliances.
Modern South Africa exists because of both conflict and cooperation.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🇺🇸 The British Were Doing the Same Thing in America. They took land, fought wars, and made a mess of things—sound familiar?
🇮🇳 The British Were Also Colonizing India at the Same Time. They promised trade, brought bureaucracy, and left a giant mess when they finally left.
🇦🇺 The Aboriginal Struggle Was Strikingly Similar. Just like the Khoisan, they lived sustainably for thousands of years—until 'progress' (and some bad decisions) arrived.

A Clash That Would Define the Future
By this point, Southern Africa was no longer just a land of ancient traditions and slow migrations. It had become a land of competing interests, colliding cultures, and growing tensions.
And the battle for control?
It was only just beginning.


Chapter 3: How We Went From Animal Skins to Three-Piece Suits in the African Heat

Before colonization, Africans dressed according to climate, culture, and common sense.
The Khoisan wore minimal clothing, because Southern Africa is hot, and walking long distances in thick fabric is not fun.
The Xhosa wore animal skins and beadwork, dressing up or down based on the occasion.
The Zulu had their iconic attire, perfect for battle, ceremonies, and everyday life.
Everything was functional, comfortable, and suited to the African environment. No one was sweating in wool suits or suffering through summer in leather shoes.
Then, Europeans arrived, looked around, and said, “No, no, no—this won’t do.”
And so began The Great Clothing Crusade, where people who clearly didn’t understand African weather decided to fix a problem that didn’t exist.

Missionaries, Modesty, and the Madness of Wool in Africa
The first major push for “proper” clothing came from missionaries, who saw bare skin and traditional attire and concluded: “These poor souls are living like savages! We must save them.”
Never mind that:
It was 35°C (95°F) in the shade.
The missionaries were the ones sweating in thick robes.
No one asked them for fashion advice.
The missionaries believed that modesty equaled civilization, so they started handing out trousers, dresses, and coats, convincing people that “progress” meant covering up.
And slowly but surely, African attire started changing.

From Function to Fashion: The New “Civilized” Look
Once Europeans decided what was “proper” clothing, colonial governments made it official.
✅ Want to work in colonial administration? Suit up.
 ✅ Want to be seen as “educated”? No more animal skins—Western-style outfits only.
 ✅ Want to be respected? Say goodbye to comfort.
Soon, we had:
“Sunday best” outfits—modeled after European fashion, even though African ceremonies never required a dress code before.
School uniforms—because apparently, looking identical made learning easier.
Formal work attire—because nothing says “progress” like sweating through a three-piece suit at midday.
And the worst part? We started enforcing these rules on ourselves.
If you walked into a government office in traditional attire, people looked at you funny.
If you wore Western clothes, you were suddenly seen as more educated.
If you didn’t have “nice” clothes, you weren’t just poor—you were “uncivilized.”
And just like that, colonialism won—one outfit at a time.

The Unholy Alliance: Missionaries, Business, and the Textile Industry
Now, let’s not pretend this was only about morality. There was money involved.
European textile manufacturers saw an opportunity:
1️⃣ Convince Africans their clothes aren’t good enough.
 2️⃣ Introduce “proper” clothes.
 3️⃣ Sell them those clothes.
 4️⃣ Profit.
It’s the same trick used today—where the fashion industry convinces people that last year’s perfectly good clothes are now “out of style,” forcing them to buy new ones.
So, Africans—who had dressed comfortably and practically for generations—started spending money on clothes that made no sense for their environment.
Fast-forward to today, and what do we see?
People wearing three-piece suits in scorching heat, sweating for the sake of “professionalism.”
Schoolchildren in woolen uniforms, barely surviving summer afternoons.
Entire cultures abandoning their clothing traditions in favor of Western fashion.
And here’s the biggest joke of all:
The same Western societies that forced Africans into Victorian attire are now practically walking around naked.
Kanye West’s wife? One strong gust of wind away from a public indecency charge.
Hollywood red carpets? They’ve gone full Khoisan mode—only with a higher price tag.
Jeff Bezos’ girlfriend? If the missionaries saw her, they’d faint on the spot.
So let’s get this straight:
They made our ancestors suffer through layers of thick clothing in the African heat—all in the name of “civilization.”
Now they walk around half-naked, in the miserable weather of London, and suddenly it’s called fashion.
Somewhere in the spirit world, an old Xhosa elder in a leopard-skin wrap is shaking his head and saying, “We suffered for NOTHING.”

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🌎 Indigenous Brazilians also had their traditional attire replaced by European fashion standards. Now, if you walk into a Brazilian bank in anything other than a suit, people assume you’re unemployed—even if it’s 40°C outside.
🇯🇵 Japan modernized in the 1800s, abandoning traditional kimonos in favor of Western suits—only to realize later that suits make no sense in humid Japanese summers.
🇳🇬 Pre-colonial Nigeria’s flowing robes were perfect for the heat. Then colonization arrived, and suddenly, tight suits and stiff collars became a status symbol.
🇷🇺 Russians, who live in one of the coldest places on Earth, somehow decided their military uniform should include tall furry hats and heavy coats—which looked great, but turned into sweat lodges indoors.
🇬🇧 The British, who made Africa dress “modestly,” are now fine with celebrities wearing outfits that look like they were stolen from a fishing net.

What Can We Learn From This?
✅ Colonialism didn’t just take land—it took fashion sense too. Before colonization, Africans dressed for their environment. After colonization, we were told that only Western clothes mattered.
✅ Marketing and control go hand in hand. The fashion industry still uses the same tactics today—convincing people they need things they don’t.
✅ Irony is everywhere. Europeans forced Africans to wear suits in the heat. Now, they wear shorts and sandals while we sweat through formal wear.





Chapter 4: How They Tried to Convert Us

Before colonialism, bureaucracy, and the invention of the queue at Home Affairs, African people had their own spiritual systems.
The Khoisan had their connection to nature, honoring the spirits of their ancestors and the land they walked on.
The Bantu had their ancestral traditions, believing that the living and the dead were connected, and that wisdom didn’t come from books—it came from the elders who had lived through things and had the scars to prove it.
We had healers instead of priests, rituals instead of pews, and a belief system that wasn’t about controlling people—it was about guiding them.
Then, the missionaries arrived, looked around, and said:
“These poor souls don’t know God. We must save them.”
Now, here’s the thing—we didn’t realize we needed saving.
Just like most healthy people didn’t think they needed a Covid vaccine, but were told repeatedly that they did.
Just like people living perfectly fine lives are suddenly told they need a life coach, a self-help book, or a “seven-step plan” to be complete.
Just like we didn’t know we were “uncivilized” until the people who barely bathed told us so.
Apparently, what we thought didn’t matter.
They knew what was best for us.
And so, just like that, we were introduced to the Great Spiritual Upgrade—whether we asked for it or not.

The First Attempt at Converting Us: The Guilt Campaign
The missionaries, bless them, had one major strategy: convince us we were sinners, then offer us salvation.
This was not an easy task, because:
We weren’t exactly feeling guilty.


Unlike Europe, where religious guilt came free with every birth certificate, we didn’t have concepts like original sin. We believed that if you did good, good would come back to you. If you did bad, well… the ancestors were watching.
We already had spiritual leaders.


We had sangomas, elders, and wise men and women who handled spiritual matters. So when the missionaries said, “We bring you the Word of God!” our ancestors said, “Thanks, but we already talked to our ancestors, and they replied.”
Their rules made no sense.


No dancing? No drumming? No beer at ceremonies? This was like showing up to a wedding and saying “No one is allowed to celebrate.”
But the missionaries weren’t going to give up that easily.

The Second Attempt: Schools and Churches
Realizing that telling us to stop dancing wasn’t working, the missionaries switched tactics.
They started building schools and churches, with the promise that if we accepted their teachings:
We would become “educated” (translation: "You will be taught how to follow our system.")
We would be closer to God (translation: "You will do things our way.")
We would be more civilized (translation: "You will abandon your ways and adopt ours.")
And, to be fair, some people did convert.
Not because they suddenly believed European Christianity was better, but because being educated meant getting opportunities, and opportunities meant survival in the new colonial world.
Others converted because mission schools were the only places where you could learn to read and write—which, in a world being taken over by paperwork and laws, was suddenly a very important skill.
So, bit by bit, our traditional ways were being replaced—not because we were convinced they were wrong, but because the system left us with no choice.

The Third Attempt: The Fear Factor
When education and guilt weren’t enough, they pulled out the big guns:
“If you don’t convert, you will burn in hell!”
“Your ancestors? False gods! You must abandon them!”
“All your traditions are evil!”
Picture this: A missionary arrives at a Xhosa village to lecture an elder—someone who's survived wars, droughts, and probably took a knobkerrie to the head back when dodging wooden clubs was the local sport. The missionary's big message? 'Stop talking to your ancestors to reach God... it's dangerous! By the way, have you heard about our main spiritual intermediary? He died about 2000 years ago.'
The elder, who has spent decades connecting with Qamata through time-honored ancestral traditions, sits there trying not to roll their eyes as the missionary explains how communicating with the deceased is strictly forbidden... right before launching into a detailed account of how they personally have a deep relationship with a particular Middle Eastern ancestor from two millennia ago.
The real kicker? The same missionary who's warning about the perils of connecting with spirits is eagerly introducing the concept of a Holy Spirit. The elder probably wished they had that knobkerrie handy just to have something to lean on while processing this particular piece of theological gymnastics."

Christianity in Africa Today: A Mixed Bag
Now, let’s be fair—Christianity isn’t all bad.
It brought a sense of unity among different African groups, who had to adapt the religion in their own way.
Many Africans today have merged Christianity with their ancestral beliefs, proving once again that we don’t just accept things—we adapt them.
Some churches have become powerful social and political forces, helping communities where governments have failed.
But it’s also left a few strange contradictions:
People will go to church on Sunday but still visit a sangoma on Monday—just in case.
Some African churches now look more “African” than Christian—complete with drumming, dancing, and long ceremonies, proving that our ancestors’ ways never really left.
Some pastors have turned faith into a business, selling everything from holy water to miracle cures for diseases, proving that not all colonizers were European.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🇲🇽 When the Spanish arrived, they forced Catholicism on the native people—but instead of abandoning their gods, the Mexicans just merged Catholic saints with their own deities. Now, they have things like Day of the Dead, where Christianity and ancient traditions mix perfectly.
🇮🇩 was Hindu and Buddhist for centuries before Islam arrived. But instead of completely erasing the old ways, their form of Islam still keeps elements of past traditions, because religion never truly erases culture.
🇯🇵 When Christian missionaries arrived in the 1500s, Japan allowed Christianity for a while, then got tired of them and banned the religion completely for 250 years. Now, Christianity is back, but only 1% of the population follows it—proving that some countries had stronger boundaries than we did.
🇷🇺. The Russian Orthodox Church is one of the oldest Christian institutions, but it still keeps a lot of pre-Christian traditions, showing that even the strongest religions adapt over time.
🇬🇭 . Ghanaian churches today are known for their vibrant, energetic worship services, proving that Christianity might have changed Africa, but Africa also changed Christianity.

What Can We Learn From This?
Religious conversion is never just about faith—it’s also about power.


The missionaries didn’t just bring God, they brought European culture, politics, and control.
African spirituality never fully disappeared.


It merged, adapted, and found ways to survive, even in modern Christianity.
Irony is everywhere.


Europeans told us to abandon our ways, yet now, many of them are turning to African spirituality, meditation, and ancestor veneration.





Chapter 5: How School Became a Factory for Workers, Not Thinkers

Before formal schooling, knowledge was passed down through storytelling, mentorship, and hands-on experience. You learned what you needed for survival, leadership, and wisdom—directly from those who had mastered their crafts.
Then came colonization, and with it, a school system designed not to educate, but to produce obedient workers. Thinking was secondary. Compliance was key.

Pre-Colonial Education: Learning by Doing
In African societies, learning was:
Practical – You learned farming by farming, healing by healing, and leading by leading.
Community-driven – Elders, warriors, and artisans passed down skills to the next generation.
Spiritual and moral – Education included values, ethics, and wisdom, not just facts.
There were no classrooms, no rigid schedules—just life as the classroom, where everyone contributed to the community’s survival.
Then came the Europeans, and suddenly, education wasn’t about learning how to live. It was about learning how to serve.

Colonial Schools: Designed for Obedience, Not Intelligence
Colonial powers needed workers, not thinkers. So, they introduced schools that:
✅ Taught just enough literacy and numeracy to create clerks, not innovators.
 ✅ Emphasized obedience over creativity, punishing questioning minds.
 ✅ Erased indigenous knowledge, replacing it with European history, language, and ideals.
Instead of preparing children to build communities, schools trained them to work in offices, factories, and mines—for someone else.
And that mentality never left.

Modern Schooling: A Legacy of Control
Fast-forward to today, and schooling still looks a lot like a colonial training camp:
Memorize, don’t question.
Pass exams, don’t think critically.
Follow instructions, don’t innovate.
The school bell? A relic from factory shifts. Uniforms? A sign of discipline, not individuality. The curriculum? Still shaped by outdated colonial-era frameworks.
Even when people demand better education, they rarely ask: Better for what? Because a system designed for obedience can’t suddenly produce free thinkers.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🌎 Finland ditched standardized testing and ranks among the best in global education.
 🇩🇪 Germany’s apprenticeships blend hands-on experience with formal learning.
 🇨🇳 China produces top performers—but at the cost of extreme pressure.
 🇺🇸 The U.S. system is heavily standardized, yet still struggles with outcomes.

What Can We Learn From This?
✅ School was never designed to empower—it was designed to indoctrinate and train obedient employees. The traditional formal school model of education still influences the way we learn today.
✅ Real learning happens beyond the classroom. Knowledge that improves life—skills, creativity, problem-solving—can’t be memorized for a test.
✅ Education needs reform, not repetition. A new model should prioritize critical thinking, adaptability, and real-world skills over outdated traditions.
The question is: Do we want students who comply, or thinkers who challenge the world?



Chapter 6: How We Went From Strong Families to Fatherless Homes—And Called It Progress

Before: Family Was Wealth—Now, It’s Just an Expense
Before colonization, wealth wasn’t measured in money.
A family's wealth among the Khoi and San was not measured in accumulated possessions, but rather by the number of strong, healthy children they had to carry on their lineage.
A strong family wasn’t the one with the biggest house—but the one with the strongest bonds and the most stability.
The future wasn’t secured by bank accounts—it was secured by the people you raised to carry on the family name.
Then the colonizers came, looked at this system, and said: “No, no, no—I don’t like that.”
They introduced a new system of wealth.
Now, wealth was measured in money, not people.
Now, success was defined by what you owned, not who you raised.
Now, children were no longer an investment—they were a financial burden.
And today?
Marriage rates have plummeted.
People are having fewer children—or none at all.
Developed countries are experiencing a population collapse that threatens their entire economies.
But hey, at least we “advanced,” right?

How We Went From Valuing Life to Valuing Things
The traditional African family model ensured continuity.
If you had more children, you had more hands to help with work, more people to care for the elderly, and more strength to defend the family.
Extended families meant no one was left alone—because blood ties are permanent.
Fast-forward to today:
People prioritize careers over children.
Elders are abandoned because there are no children left to care for them.
Governments are now panicking over low birth rates—after spending decades discouraging large families.
The irony?
Japan, China, and many European nations now have declining populations—so much that they’re begging people to have more kids.
China’s one-child policy created a generational gap they can’t recover from.
South Korea is now paying people to get married and have babies—because modernity destroyed family culture.
But when Africa had large families, we were called “uncivilized.”

Ukuthwala: The Marriage Practice That Shocked the Colonizers
One of the first customs the Europeans condemned was ukuthwala.
This was not “kidnapping,” as the Europeans claimed—it was a form of arranged marriage.
A young man who wanted to marry a woman (especially if her family disapproved) could arrange to "take" her to his family.
Negotiations between the families would follow, ensuring she was well cared for.
This practice:
✅ Ensured women married within a stable structure.
 ✅ Gave families control over ensuring their daughters were provided for.
 ✅ Reduced unwanted pregnancies and STDs, since early marriage meant fewer sexual partners.
But the colonizers looked at this structured system and decided it was “oppression.”
So they banned it.
And today?
Women are now “free” to have children with multiple absent fathers.
STDs and unwanted pregnancies have skyrocketed.
The government is now forced to pay child grants—funded by taxpayers.
So remind me again—who benefited from banning ukuthwala?

Polygamy: The Safety Net That Westerners Called Barbaric
Before colonization, polygamy wasn’t about “male domination”—it was about stability.
1️⃣ No woman was left unprotected or without support.
 2️⃣ Men were expected to provide for all their wives and children.
 3️⃣ Women had a built-in support system through co-wives, rather than struggling alone.
But then the missionaries arrived, clutched their Bibles, and declared: “No, no, no—I don’t like that.”
According to them:
🚨 Polygamy was sinful! (Meanwhile, European kings had mistresses and illegitimate children everywhere.)
 🚨 Polygamy was oppressive to women! (Meanwhile, single mothers today work three jobs just to survive.)
And so, polygamy was condemned.
The result?
Women are now raising children alone, without financial or emotional support.
Men are still having multiple partners—but now, they don’t have to provide for them.
Instead of co-wives helping each other, single mothers now depend on social grants.
At least now, it’s “civilized.”

The Extended Family: When No Child Grew Up Without a Father Figure
In traditional African society, a child was never “fatherless.”
If the father died, uncles stepped in.
If a child was orphaned, the extended family raised them.
Grandparents played a key role in passing down wisdom.
There was no such thing as “single parenting.”
But then came the nuclear family model—imported from Europe.
Now, fathers leave and never come back.
Children are left with mothers who have no support.
Grandparents are dumped in nursing homes instead of being respected elders.
Today, fatherless homes are the leading predictor of crime, poverty, and social instability.
But hey, at least it’s “modern,” right?

Elsewhere in the World…
🇯🇵 : One of the most technologically advanced nations—but also one of the loneliest. Low birth rates, skyrocketing elderly care costs, and an entire generation too busy working to start families. Now, the government is offering financial incentives for marriage and childbirth.
🇨🇳 : After decades of enforcing its one-child policy, China is now desperately trying to reverse its population collapse. Too little, too late—millions of elderly have no one to care for them, and the workforce is shrinking fast.
🇪🇺 : Marriage and birth rates are declining across the continent. Countries like Italy and Germany are now offering financial bonuses to people who have children.
🇺🇸 : Once the land of big families and strong communities—now the land of people choosing pets over kids because children are “too expensive.” Meanwhile, nursing homes are overflowing with abandoned elderly.

Firstborn Sons: The Unseen Burden of Traditional Responsibility
Before colonization, inheritance worked differently.
1️⃣ Women received their share when they got married.
This came in the form of cows, gifts, and resources to start their new household.
2️⃣ Firstborn sons, however, inherited responsibility—not wealth.
They were expected to manage the family estate—for everyone’s benefit.
They couldn’t just “spend” the wealth—it had to be used for current and future generations.
The Europeans looked at this and decided it was unfair—to women.
So they introduced European inheritance laws, where:
❌ The firstborn son no longer had an obligation to care for the family.
 ❌ Women were no longer expected to marry for security—they could now “be independent.”
And now?
❌ The state, which ironically still collected most of its revenue from men, replaced husbands as the provider for women.
Women still suffer under economic instability.
Elders are abandoned because no one feels responsible for them.
The family unit has disintegrated.
At least now, “everyone is equal.”

What Did We Gain? What Did We Lose?
Let’s be fair—some good things came from changing marriage customs.
✅ Women gained more legal rights. (Though, ironically, they still suffer the most in modern society when compared to men.)
 ✅ Forced marriages declined. (Which is great—but were they really "forced" or just family-arranged for security?)
 ✅ Women got more freedom to choose their own partners. (Which is great, except now, they’re more likely to end up raising children alone.)
But let’s be real—what did we lose?
❌ Family bonds weakened. Women now struggle alone.
 ❌ Fatherless homes skyrocketed. Children grow up without discipline or direction.
 ❌ Crime increased. Studies prove that fatherless boys are more likely to become criminals.
So remind me again—who really benefited from all these “progressive” changes?

Chapter7: The Illusion of Order—How "Progress" Created Division

Before the British came with their legal systems, the Xhosa had their own way of maintaining order:
Chiefs and elders resolved disputes
Land belonged to the community
Trade happened through cattle and bartering
Then the British looked at this and said: "No, no, no—I don't like that."
According to them, we needed:
Written laws instead of oral traditions
Individual land ownership instead of communal living
Money instead of cattle for trade
And so began the great "civilizing mission"—whether we wanted it or not.

The Convenience That Became a Trap
Let's be honest—some changes were good:
✅ Education opened new opportunities
✅ Railways made travel easier
✅ Modern medicine saved lives
✅ Electricity made life convenient

But here's the twist:
Once we got used to these things, we couldn't go back.
Once our children went to school, they needed jobs.
Once we used money, we needed more of it.
Once we lived in towns, we couldn't just return to tribal life.
The system made us dependent on it—then used that dependency against us.

How the English Played Everyone
The British were masters at the game of divide and rule:
1️⃣ First, they fought the Xhosa
2️⃣ Then, they fought the Boers
3️⃣ Then, they made the Boers fight the Xhosa
4️⃣ Finally, they sat back and watched the chaos

Their strategy was brilliant (and terrible):
✅ Give some groups privileges over others
✅ Make everyone depend on their system
✅ Create divisions between people who once lived together
✅ Pretend to be the "civilized" referees in conflicts they created

The Birth of New Tribes
The system didn't just divide existing groups—it created new ones:
The Afrikaners:
Started as Dutch farmers
Developed their own language and identity
Broke away from British control
Eventually created apartheid to protect their new identity

The "School People" (Amagqobhoka):
Xhosa who embraced Western education
Often looked down on traditional ways
Created a new elite class among Africans
Sometimes helped enforce colonial rules

The "Red People" (Amaqaba):
Those who kept traditional ways
Resisted Western influence
Were often marginalized by both systems
Struggled to maintain their identity

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World...
🇮🇳: The British used the same divide-and-rule tactics, turning princes against each other
🇨🇳: Foreign powers carved up the country into "spheres of influence"
🇺🇸: Native Americans were forced onto reservations "for their own protection"
🇦🇺: Aboriginals were classified by blood percentage, dividing families
🇳🇿: The Maori signed a treaty that meant one thing in English and another in their language

The System That Created Its Own Resistance
The more "order" they imposed:
❌ The more people fought to participate in the system they now depended on
❌ The more educated Africans demanded equal rights
❌ The more the Afrikaners wanted independence from British control
❌ The more complex the laws became to maintain control

From Segregation to Apartheid
The road to apartheid didn't start in 1948—it started with:
1️⃣ The Glen Grey Act of 1894: Which limited land ownership
2️⃣ The Native Land Act of 1913: Which restricted where we could live
3️⃣ The Native Urban Areas Act of 1923: Which controlled our movement
4️⃣ The Natives Representation Act of 1936: Which removed voting rights

What Did This "Order" Really Create?
Let's be honest about what happened:
✅ We got education—but it came with cultural erasure
✅ We got modern convenience—but lost independence
✅ We got "civilization"—but lost our ways of maintaining order
✅ We got progress—but it came with oppression

The Final Irony
The system that was supposed to bring order:
Created new tribes instead of uniting people
Made everyone dependent on it while excluding most from its benefits
Turned neighbors into not only strangers but enemies
Created resistance from the very "progress" it brought

Because at the end of the day, true order doesn't come from imposing one system over another.
It comes from respecting that different people can have different ways of creating order.


Part 2
Chapter 8: The Rainbow That Came With a Storm

Once upon a time, South Africans believed in miracles.
We believed that 1994 meant the start of true equality before the law.
We believed that democracy would bring opportunity for all.
We believed that politicians had our best interests at heart.
For a brief moment, it felt like we had made it.
People hugged in the streets.
The national anthem was rewritten to include everyone.
The world praised us as a symbol of peace and reconciliation.
But here’s the thing about rainbows: they only come after a storm… and sometimes, another storm follows.

The Rainbow Dream: What We Were Told Would Happen
In 1994, South Africa promised itself a fresh start.
Apartheid was gone.
Discrimination was over.
We were all equal before the law, no matter our race or sex.
At least, that’s what the Constitution said.
For a moment, it actually seemed like we were moving forward.
Black and white South Africans worked together, studied together, and built businesses together.
The country opened itself to foreign investment, trade, and opportunity.
The world saw us as a model of reconciliation.
But while ordinary South Africans were busy shaking hands and singing the new national anthem, politicians were cooking up something else entirely—a new racial division, but this time, with a business model.
While most of us got stuck on the “equal before the law” part of the Constitution, thinking it meant unity, the politicians were flipping pages like seasoned con artists, landing on the fine print: the redress provision.
We saw democracy. They saw a loophole.
We saw equality. They saw race hustling as a long-term investment strategy.
And before we knew it, BEE, race quotas, and preferential policies became the foundation of a new elite class.

How the Rainbow Was Stolen
It didn’t take long before the new government realized something important:
A united South Africa didn’t benefit them.
If people saw each other as equals, they wouldn’t vote based on race.
If people worked together, they wouldn’t need politicians to “fix” things for them.
If people stopped focusing on apartheid, they might start noticing government corruption instead.
So, they did what all politicians do best:
They made sure the past never left.
They made sure racial and sex division remained useful.
They made sure blame could always be shifted.
Because if you keep people fighting each other, they won’t notice that you’re robbing them blind.
And that’s exactly what happened.

From Liberation Movement to Looting Movement
Let’s compare.
Then (Apartheid Government, Flawed But Functional)
Government was oppressive, but at least it functioned—trains ran, power stations worked, and infrastructure existed.
It was unjust, but at least it wasn’t completely incompetent.
Now (ANC Government, Free But Failing)
Government is “for the people,” but the people are unemployed, starving, and watching corruption get worse.
It is “democratic,” but somehow, the same people keep getting re-elected despite failing.
It is “equal,” but policies still prioritize race and sex over competence.
And worst of all?
It is “transparent,” yet money disappears faster than you can say “State Capture.”
At this point, we need to ask:
Did we get freedom, or did we just get new masters with different surnames?

The Economy of Racial Division: Keeping the Past Alive for Profit
BEE, affirmative action, and racial quotas became a billion-rand industry of corruption, incompetence, and political favoritism.
Competent people were pushed out in favor of politically connected individuals.
Government contracts are awarded not to the best companies, but to the best bribe-payers.
State-owned enterprises have been looted in the name of “transformation.”
And yet, every time things got worse, the government had the same excuse:
“It’s apartheid’s fault.”
Eskom fails? Apartheid.
Crime increases? Apartheid.
Billions stolen from taxpayers? Apartheid.
Millions of currency found in Phala Phala?  Apartheid.
At some point, you have to ask:
Is apartheid running the government from the grave?

The Biggest Lie: “Free” Things
One of the biggest post-1994 myths was that government could provide for the people.
Housing? Free! (If you don’t mind waiting decades for an RDP house that might collapse before it’s even allocated to you.)
Education? Free! (But quality? That costs extra.)
Electricity? Free! (Unless you actually expect it to work.)
But here’s the problem:
Nothing is free.
The government has no money—it only has taxpayer money.
And the more the government "gives," the more it takes from those who actually work.
And guess who funds it all?
Men and Minorities. (Who contribute the most in personal income tax, yet benefit the least.)
White South Africans. (Who are legally excluded from many government opportunities, but never from paying tax.)
Business owners. (Who are told they must “give back” , as if providing services and employment was not enough, while the government takes everything.)
Meanwhile, the biggest beneficiaries are:
Women. (Who are prioritized in jobs, education, and business, funded by tax money that comes mostly from men.)
Black South Africans. (Who receive exclusive tax funded support, while white taxpayers are expected to fund it without complaint while benefiting the least)
Politicians. (Who promise “empowerment” but somehow end up empowering only themselves and their friends.)
And here’s where it gets ridiculous:
There is no program that excludes women from benefiting—but there are many that exclude men.
There is no law that prevents black people from paying tax—but there are laws that prevent white people from benefiting.
This is not justice.
This is just a redistribution scheme disguised as progress.
At this point, the only truly equal opportunity left in South Africa is the opportunity to be robbed and murdered.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🇺🇸 : The land of “equality,” where government gives race-based scholarships while pretending to be colorblind.
🇮🇳 : A country where caste-based reservations ensure that some groups get priority jobs and education—just like BEE.
🇳🇬 : A democracy where leaders steal billions, blame colonialism, and keep getting re-elected.
🇷🇺 : A place where government critics disappear, proving that South Africa isn’t THAT bad (yet).
🇧🇷 : A country that fought for democracy, only to end up with leaders who steal as much as the dictators before them.
Zimbabwe: A reminder that bad governance can collapse a country faster than any external enemy.

What Can We Learn From This?
Racial division benefits politicians, not ordinary people.


White and black South Africans are both suffering under ANC misrule.
The only ones winning? The corrupt elite.
Free things aren’t free—someone always pays.


Government has no money—it only has taxpayers’ money.
The more the government “gives,” the more it takes from those who actually work.
Merit matters more than race or sex.


Hiring based on race and sex instead of skill is why we have a skills shortage.
It’s why we import artisans and engineers while locals remain unemployed.
At some point, we need to admit:
It’s not apartheid that’s holding us back anymore—it’s bad governance.


Chapter 9: How We Traded Practical Skills for Useless Papers and Still Ended Up Unemployed

Once upon a time—before democracy, bureaucracy, and BEE quotas—South Africa had an education system that, while far from perfect, at least made sure people could do something useful.
During apartheid, education was deeply unequal—but the government, for all its injustices, at least believed in practical skills.
Schools and colleges trained artisans, mechanics, electricians, and factory workers.
If you had a skill, you had a job.
Then democracy arrived, and the new government—determined to erase everything associated with the past—decided that practical education had to go too.
Technical colleges? Downgraded.
Trade schools? Underfunded.
Factories that once employed thousands? Shut down.
In their place? A system that prioritized “academic excellence” over actual competence.
The result?
There are countless graduates who can eloquently discuss critical race theory but struggle to support themselves without taxpayer support.
We produce PhD holders who are unemployed, while we import welders, mechanics, and electricians from other countries.
The same government that killed technical skills is now crying about a "skills shortage"—as if it wasn't their own doing.
Somewhere in 1994, a government official must have stood up in a meeting and said:
"Let’s destroy everything that works, and then complain when nothing works!"
And everyone else nodded.

When Education Was About What You Could Do
Let’s compare.
Then (Apartheid Education System, Flawed But Functional):
Education was unequal, racist, and unfair—let’s not sugarcoat it.
BUT, the people who went through the system could at least work.
Technical skills were prioritized—if you were trained in something, you could prove your ability by actually doing it.
Factories, industries, and trades flourished because practical skills were valued.
Now (Democratic South Africa’s Education System):
Education is “equal,” but it produces unemployable graduates.
Degrees, not skills, are prioritized—because writing a thesis is apparently more important than fixing the country’s electricity grid.
Instead of training local artisans, we now import them—paying foreign workers to do the jobs our own people should be doing.
And somehow, the unemployment rate just keeps getting worse.
At this point, you have to ask:
Did we really improve education, or did we just create a more expensive way to produce useless workers?

Degrees vs. Skills: The Great Lie
Somewhere along the way, someone convinced South Africans that the key to success was getting a degree.
Not skills. Not experience. Not real-world ability.
No—just a piece of paper.
And what happened?
People started chasing degrees instead of skills.


“It doesn’t matter what I study, as long as I have a degree!”
And so, we produced thousands of graduates in fields that have no jobs.
People started faking degrees.


Because let’s be honest—skills can’t be faked, but a qualification can.
Some people just memorized the final answers. Others? Straight-up bought their degrees.
Meanwhile, people with no degrees but actual skills thrived.
The farmer is growing food and feeding himself and the country.
The builder and carpenter is creating homes to house families.
The unemployed graduate is still "waiting for an opportunity."
At some point, we have to admit that we’ve been scammed.

The Government’s Role: Breaking What Worked and Complaining About It
When the democratic government took over, they had the perfect opportunity to fix what was broken.
They could have kept the technical skills system, while making it accessible to all races.
They could have built more trade schools, training centers, and industries.
They could have created an economy where EVERYONE had a chance to succeed.
But instead?
They shut down functioning schools and factories, then introduced “outcomes-based education,” which failed spectacularly.
They pushed university degrees as the only path to success, ignoring the need for artisans and technicians.
Now, they spend billions on importing the very skills they killed off.
The worst part?
They still don’t see the irony.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🇩🇪 : They never fell for the “everyone needs a degree” scam. Instead, they have one of the best vocational training systems in the world—which is why their economy thrives while ours struggles.
🇧🇷 : They realized their universities were producing too many unemployed graduates, so they invested in trade schools—now, their skilled workers are thriving.
🇷🇺 : The West thought sanctions would cripple Russia, but instead, it adapted and thrived.
Russia maintained its technical schools, ensuring there were always skilled workers to build and sustain the country.
Even as Western companies left, Russia developed local alternatives and redirected trade to Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
While other economies struggle with outsourcing, Russia doubled down on industrial and technical expertise, proving that self-sufficiency matters more than foreign approval..
🇨🇳 : They train millions of workers in both academic and practical skills, which is why they manufacture everything while we struggle to fix potholes.
🇮🇳 : They have some of the best engineers and IT professionals in the world—but they also train millions in hands-on trades.

What Can We Learn From This?
A degree does not equal success.


If it did, we wouldn’t have so many unemployed graduates.
Skills, experience, and adaptability matter more than a piece of paper.
Practical education is more important than theoretical learning.


A plumber doesn’t need to write a 40-page thesis on pipes.
An electrician doesn’t need a dissertation on volts and watts.
They just need to do the job well.
We destroyed technical skills—and we are paying the price.


We now have a “skills crisis” that didn’t exist before.
We import welders, engineers, and artisans instead of training our own people.
Instead of fixing the problem, we just create more committees to “investigate” it.
At some point, we need to stop pretending.


Chapter 10: How the Criminals Get Free Meals While the Victims Pay the Bill)

Once upon a time, justice was swift, simple, and actually worked.
In precolonial times, crime was personal. If you stole, you repaid double—or risked exile. If you killed, the victim’s family decided your fate.
During apartheid, crime was low—not because people were angels, but because the police were feared. You didn’t want to end up in prison making bricks for the government.
Then democracy came, and suddenly, criminals got more rights than their victims. The police became underfunded, prisons became rehabilitation centers, and convicted murderers got to go on parole—sometimes to commit murder again.
South Africa didn’t just stop punishing criminals—it started rewarding them.
You get free food.
You get free healthcare.
You get a chance at parole.
Meanwhile, your victim gets trauma, legal fees, and possibly a funeral.
At this point, we need to ask:
Are we running a justice system, or a government-sponsored criminal internship program?

Justice Before vs. Now: A History of Decline
Let’s break it down.
1. Precolonial Justice: Swift, Personal, and Logical
Before prisons, courts, and legal loopholes, justice was handled at the community level.
Crime was dealt with by the people who suffered from it, or at least with their input on the punishment.
If you stole, you repaid—plus extra, as an apology.
If you killed, you either made amends with the family or faced their wrath.
If you were a repeat offender, you were cast out—exiled if not killed, forgotten, done.
There was no prison, no parole, no tax-funded meals.
Justice was fast. No five-year trials, no endless appeals.
Justice was fair. If you harmed someone, you faced the community.
Justice made sense. If you stole from your neighbor, you didn’t get free food—you were expected to fix the damage.
And most importantly, criminals had to make amends to the victim—not to the government.
Now? Victims get nothing while criminals get three meals a day, free exercise, and sometimes a law degree.

Apartheid Justice: Brutal, But Effective
Let’s be clear: Apartheid’s laws were racist, unjust, and cruel.
But if you committed a crime—you paid for it.
The police were feared. They didn’t play games. If you got caught, there was no political speech about your “childhood struggles”—you went straight to jail.
Prison was actual punishment. Inmates built roads, made bricks, and worked for the state.
The death penalty was real. If you killed, you got killed back—simple.
And what was the result?
Crime was lower.
Prisoners actually worked to pay for what they consumed.
Criminals weren’t considered victims of society—they were just criminals.
Was the racial discrimination of the system unfair? Yes.
 Was it corrupt? Yes.
 Did it work better than what we have now? Also yes.
Because at least criminals weren’t treated like VIP guests at a taxpayer-funded resort.

Democratic Justice: Where Criminals Have More Rights Than Victims
Then came 1994, freedom, and the dream of justice for all.
We ended the death penalty.
We introduced parole—even for violent criminals.
We made prison life comfortable with free food, education, and healthcare.
And what happened?
Crime exploded.
Police became underfunded and ineffective.
Prisons became “rehabilitation centers”  that instead created hardened criminals.
And somehow, the first president of this new democracy was an ex-convict.
Not a coincidence.
Not a fluke.
It set the tone for everything that followed.
Now, being a criminal isn’t a failure—it’s a potential career path.

The ANC: Leading by Example in Criminality
It’s no wonder crime is high—our leaders do it too.
Ministers steal billions, then give speeches about fighting corruption with a straight face.
Jacob Zuma and Tony Yengeni were too sick to serve their full sentences—until they were miraculously healed by parole and seen playing golf and dancing.
The Minister of Justice is under investigation for a dodgy VBS loan—but don't worry, the case will probably disappear faster than state funds.
The president was found with cash stuffed under his couch, yet somehow, he’s still in office.
ANC politicians looted COVID-19 relief funds, meant for the sick and dying, proving that even a global pandemic couldn’t slow down their corruption.
If the leaders are looting the country dry, why should the criminals on the street behave any differently?
At this point, you have to ask: Who’s the real gang? The guys in prison, or the guys in parliament?

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🇺🇸 : Under the Biden-Harris administration, shoplifting under $1,000 is a misdemeanor. Criminals walk into stores, take what they want, and leave. Employees are told not to stop them.
🇬🇧: The nation that once ruled through "law and order" now shows us five fascinating ironies:
1️⃣ The police have stopped investigating "minor crimes" like burglary and theft because they're "too busy"—but they have plenty of time to arrest people for social media posts. The same nation that created complex systems to control colonies now can't control basic crime in their own streets.
2️⃣ Once exported their legal system across the globe claiming it was the most advanced—now their courts are so backlogged that victims wait years for justice, while "hate speech" cases get fast-tracked through the system.
3️⃣ Used to send police across the empire to "maintain order"—now their police are too afraid to stop actual crime in certain areas because it might appear "culturally insensitive." The empire that once policed the world can't even police its own neighborhoods.
4️⃣ Created detailed racial classification systems in their colonies—now claim they're "colorblind" while their own statistics show massive racial disparities in arrests and convictions. The difference? They just don't talk about it anymore.
5️⃣ Once proud of their "British values" and imposed them on others—now struggle to define what those values are, while arresting citizens for "causing offense" online. The nation that taught us about freedom of speech now polices jokes on Twitter.

What Can We Learn From This?
Justice used to be swift, but now it’s a business.


Lawyers get rich, criminals get chances, and victims get nothing.
Criminals have more rights than law-abiding citizens.


Free food, free housing, free education—all while taxpayers suffer.
If crime pays more than honest work, why would anyone stop?


Politicians steal billions and stay in power.
Criminals go to prison and get out early.
Meanwhile, victims are left to rebuild their lives alone.
At some point, we need to stop pretending:
This is not justice. This is a scam.


Chapter 11: How Taxes Turned Helping People into a Soulless Transaction Instead of a Moral Duty
For most of human history, helping others wasn’t just about charity—it was about logic, reciprocity, and maintaining order.
Families took care of each other—not because they had to, but because it made sense.
Communities supported their members—not blindly, but with expectations of good behavior.
Help wasn’t just given—it was earned.
If you were struggling, your family stepped in.
A father helped his son get back on his feet.
A brother supported his unemployed sibling—but only if that sibling wasn’t a lazy bum.
A community fed a struggling family—but if that family disrespected the community, they’d find themselves on their own.
This wasn’t cruelty—it was discipline.
Help was given, but only to those who deserved it.
Assistance was temporary, not a lifelong handout.
Moral responsibility was enforced—if you broke trust, you lost support.
Then the government stepped in, took one horrified look at voluntary charity, and said: 
🚨 “No, no, no—this won’t do.” 🚨
Suddenly, helping people became mandatory, impersonal, and completely detached from morality.
You don’t get to choose who you help.
You don’t get to demand that they change their behavior.
You just get taxed—and if you refuse, you go to jail.
At this point, we need to ask: Are we supporting the poor, or are we just financing laziness and bad decisions?

The Logic of Family Support vs. The Absurdity of Government Welfare
In Families, Help Comes With Conditions
If a family member falls on hard times, they receive help.
If they’re unemployed, they get support—but they’re also expected to be actively looking for work.
If they struggle with addiction, they get a second chance—but not an unlimited supply of free money.
If they repeatedly steal from the family or refuse to change, eventually, they are cut off.
The system is simple:
You contribute, you receive.
You take advantage, you’re out.
In Government Welfare, There Are No Strings Attached
Now let’s compare that to how government "help" works.
Are welfare recipients required to give back to the community? No.
Are they required to prove they’re making an effort to improve? No.
Can they keep receiving benefits while committing crimes, refusing to work, and making no effort to contribute? Yes.
At this point, it’s no longer assistance—it’s a reward for failure.
And who funds it all?
The productive citizens who actually work.
The people who pay taxes, only to get nothing in return.
It’s one thing to help someone in need.
It’s another thing to be forced to support strangers who contribute nothing, with no accountability.

What Happens When There’s No Moral Obligation to Improve?
When families help each other, there’s an unspoken rule:
If you mess up, you get a second chance. If you mess up again, you’re out.
A father might take in his unemployed son, but if that son refuses to work, he’s eventually kicked out.
A community might support a struggling member, but if they keep stealing from neighbors, they’re exiled.
A wayward child might be given another shot—but only if they show genuine remorse and effort.
This is why traditional systems worked.
Help was a safety net, not a lifestyle.
Assistance was temporary, not an entitlement.
People were held accountable for their actions.
Now? Government assistance has none of these controls.
A person on welfare can refuse to work—and still get paid.
A criminal can get social grants—without being required to make amends to their victims.
Entire generations can grow up on government support—without ever learning the value of self-reliance.
And what happens?
A culture of entitlement replaces a culture of responsibility.
People expect handouts, but feel no duty to give back.
People demand free services, but don’t care about their own communities.
People live off the system, but contribute nothing to it.
And the ones who actually work, build, and contribute?
They get taxed into the ground to fund the very people who refuse to help themselves.

The Tax Scam: How Many Times Can They Take Your Money?
Here’s how the government makes sure they take everything from you:
You learn a skill. (If you study at a university, you pay VAT on tuition fees.)
You get a job. (You immediately start paying income tax.)
You buy a house. (You pay property tax.)
You buy food. (You pay VAT.)
You put petrol in your car. (Almost half the price is tax.)
You die. (Your assets get taxed again.)
And somehow, we’re supposed to believe this is fair.
If you risk your money to start a business and succeed, you’re punished with a heavy tax bill.
If you risk everything and fail, you get nothing.
So in success, they’re waiting to take their cut.
In failure, they don’t care.
If that’s not extortion, what is?

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🇺🇸 : People demand free healthcare, free college, and free everything—while drowning in $33 trillion of national debt.
🇬🇧 : High taxes, but somehow, even their police officers are struggling to afford food.
🇳🇬 : The government steals everything, so people just bribe their way through life instead of paying taxes.
🇮🇳 : If you don’t pay tax, the government just shrugs—because enforcement is a joke.

What Can We Learn From This?
Government welfare is not charity—it’s forced wealth redistribution.
You don’t get to choose who you help.
You don’t get to demand responsibility from them.
Real help comes with accountability.
In families, help is earned.
In government welfare, help is given with no strings attached.
If taxes are so great, why do they have to be forced?


If people truly believed in paying tax, they wouldn’t have to be threatened with prison.
At some point, we need to stop asking:
"Where is my tax money going?" because we know it's going towards funding corruption.
And start asking:
"Why am I still paying it?"


Chapter 12: The Rat Race
Once upon a time, life was about family, community, and survival.
The Khoisan hunted and gathered, moving with the seasons.
The Bantu farmed, traded, and lived in tight-knit villages.
The Xhosa worked the land, raised cattle, and passed wisdom through generations.
Yes, life had challenges, but at least people lived it.
Then, modernity arrived, took one horrified look at people simply living their lives, and said: 🚨 “No, no, no—this won’t do.” 🚨
Suddenly, the goal was no longer to live—but to work.
First, we were sent to school for 12+ years, memorizing facts we’d forget immediately after exams.
Then, we were told to get degrees (even if they were useless).
Next, we got jobs where we worked 9–5, Monday to Friday, for 40+ years.
Finally, we were allowed to retire—just in time to realize we were too old to enjoy life.
And somehow, they called this progress.

The Modern Life Formula: Work, Pay, Die
Here’s how life works now:
Spend the first 12+ years in school.


Sit in a classroom learning abstract things you’ll never use.
Spend your youth preparing for a job you might never even get.
Get a job and work until your 60s.
Wake up early. Sit in traffic. Work for 8+ hours. Sit in traffic again. Sleep. Repeat.
Have two days off a week, where you recover just enough to do it all over again.
Save for retirement (if you’re lucky).
If you somehow survive, you can finally relax…
…only to find out inflation has eaten your savings, or your pension was looted, and your body is too old to enjoy anything.
At this point, you start to wonder:
Did we really progress, or did we just turn life into a long, unpaid internship for the grave?

The Xhosa, Khoisan, and Bantu Had This Figured Out
The irony is, our ancestors already knew what we forgot.
The Khoisan didn’t spend their lives chasing money or materialistic possessions—they spent it with family and nature.
The Xhosa didn’t separate education and work from life—these were part of life.
The Bantu didn’t sit in offices—they built through trade, farming, and craftsmanship, but knew when to rest.
Compare that to now:
We wake up before sunrise to rush to work.
We spend the best years of our lives in offices, staring at screens.
We spend decades paying off a house, a car, and a lifestyle we don’t even have time to enjoy.
And the worst part?
By the time we retire, we realize that we spent our entire life… waiting to live.
At this point, you have to ask:
Is this a life—or just a really long self-inflicted punishment?

Modern Life: More Work, More Stuff, Less Fulfillment
Let’s break it down:
People are more educated than ever, but less innovated and also more broke than ever.


You can have a degree, a job, and still be struggling to afford groceries.
People are working longer hours, but getting less in return.


The corrupt get richer, while the working class stays trapped in survival mode.
People are postponing life for “later” … but later may never come.


We tell ourselves: “I’ll travel when I retire.”
“I’ll spend time with my family when I have time.”
“I’ll rest when I’m old.”
Then one day, we wake up, and we’re old.
At this point, we need to admit:
The rat race isn’t life—it’s just a very slow, very exhausting way to die.

Why Are We Doing This? Because They Lied to Us.
From childhood, we were told:
“Go to school, work hard, get a degree, and you’ll be successful!”
“Get a job, and you’ll be secure!”
“Save for retirement, and you’ll enjoy your old age!”
Now, reality is:
People with degrees are unemployed.
Jobs don’t guarantee security.
By retirement, you’re either broke, sick, or both.
And if you still have your retirement savings intact, count yourself among the fortunate few. 
And somehow, we’re still telling kids the same lie.


The Ultimate Proof of Success: The Ability to Survive and Continue
But let’s take this even further.
Forget billionaires. Look at nature.
What is the most basic definition of success for any living being? Survival.
A species is successful if it can reproduce and continue through generations.
An individual is successful if they can pass on their genes and ensure their offspring survive.
And in that regard?
I am here. You are here.
Which means: Our ancestors succeeded.
They lived long enough to have children.
They raised those children well enough that they could have their own.
They adapted, survived wars, famines, and crises.
They made it—without PhDs, without corporate jobs, without the rat race.
That is the ultimate proof that success is not measured by money, degrees, or corporate titles.
Because in the end?
The real winners are those who continue, not those who accumulate.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🇯🇵 : Work so hard that companies have a word for “death by overwork” (karoshi).
🇨🇳 : Where "996" (9am-9pm, 6 days/week) is considered normal, and they call it "blessing" to work yourself to death. 
🇰🇷 : Where "kkondae" culture means young workers are stuck between respecting hierarchy and actually getting work done. 
🇮🇳 : Where engineers code by day for Silicon Valley, sleep by night in Mumbai, and dream of moving to Canada. 
🇬🇧 : Where people commute 2 hours to London for jobs they hate, to pay mortgages they can barely afford. 
🇸🇬 : Where "kiasu" culture means your kid needs 3 tutors by age 5 just to keep up with the neighbors.

What Can We Learn From This?
A job is just a way to survive—it’s not a life.


If you’re spending all your time working, when do you actually live?
The system is built to keep you running, but never winning.


The rich work less and make more. The rest work more and make less.
If you have to wait until retirement to enjoy life, you’ve already lost.


Why wait until you’re old to start living?
At some point, we need to ask:
Is there another way?



Chapter 13: How “A Better Life for All” Became “At Least You’re Not Zimbabwe”In 1994, the ANC stood before South Africa like a sweet-talking salesman selling a miracle product.
“Vote for us, and we’ll give you jobs!” (Now, unemployment is over 30%.)
“We’ll give you free electricity!” (Eskom went from world-class to world’s biggest joke.)
“We’ll give you free education!” (But we’ll remove the quality, so degrees are useless.)
“We’ll provide free housing!” (RDP houses that collapse faster than the promises made to build them.)
It all sounded too good to be true.
Because it was.
Fast forward to 2025, and the only thing South Africans have received for free is load-shedding, crime, potholes, and a front-row seat to government corruption.
At this point, you have to wonder:
Was this incompetence or just a well-executed scam?

The Problem With “Free”
The moment a government says “this is free,” alarm bells should go off.
Nothing is free. Someone is always paying for it.
The government has no money. It only has taxpayer money.
If something is “free,” you are either paying for it through taxes or getting a downgraded, broken version.
South Africans believed the fairy tale that services could be free—and now we’re living in the horror movie where nothing works.
Here’s what was promised vs. what we actually got:
Free Electricity? We Got Load-Shedding.
The ANC promised every home would have electricity.
Instead, we have rolling blackouts, broken power stations, and diesel shortages.
Meanwhile, Eskom executives still get bonuses.
Free Water? We Got Water Shortages.
We were told “Water is a basic right!”
But somehow, municipalities forgot to maintain pipes, and now taps run dry.
Meanwhile, politicians have bottled water at their meetings.
Free Housing? We Got Corrupt Tenders.
The ANC promised millions of houses.
Instead, they gave tenders to their friends, and those friends disappeared with the money.
Meanwhile, thousands are still waiting for homes 30 years later.
Free Education? We Got Unemployable Graduates.
They said “Education will uplift the nation!”
But instead, they dumbed down the curriculum, removed practical skills, and produced a generation of graduates who can write essays on Karl Marx but can’t find a job.
Meanwhile, we import skilled workers from other countries.
Free Healthcare? We Got Dysfunctional Hospitals.
The government said “Healthcare for all!”
Now, state hospitals don’t have medication, equipment, or even working toilets.
Meanwhile, politicians fly to private hospitals (or overseas) when they get sick.
At this point, the only thing truly free in South Africa is disappointment.

The Irony: The People Who Were Promised the Most Got the Least
Here’s the sad reality:
Poor South Africans—who were promised a better life—are still waiting.
Rich South Africans—who were told they’d be punished—are the only ones still keeping the economy running.
Let’s break it down:
The unemployed were promised jobs—but the government destroyed industries that provided jobs.
The poor were promised support—but government officials stole the money meant for them.
The middle class was told they’d pay more tax—but that tax money funds corruption, not services.
And now?
The rich have left.
The middle class is shrinking.
The poor are worse off than before.
At this point, it’s not apartheid that’s holding people back—it’s the people who lied about fixing it.

Where Did the Money Go?
Every year, the government collects billions in taxes.
But somehow:
Roads are still full of potholes.
Trains don’t work.
Schools are crumbling.
Hospitals are a disaster.
Where did the money go?
To luxury mansions for politicians.
To “consulting fees” for government friends.
To international shopping trips disguised as government “conferences.”
South Africa didn’t run out of money.
The money was stolen.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🇷🇺 : Corrupt but at least they know how to keep the lights on.
🇬🇧 : High taxes, but at least the trains work, sort of.
🇺🇸 : “Free” healthcare debate still going on, but at least McDonald’s is always open.

What Can We Learn From This?
"Free" always comes at a cost.


If the government offers something for free, expect higher taxes, lower quality, or outright failure.
South Africa doesn’t have a lack of money—it has a lack of accountability.


Corruption is the reason we have no water, no electricity, and no jobs.
The people who believed the lies the most have suffered the most.


Poor South Africans were used as voting blocks, not as people to uplift.
At some point, we need to stop pretending:
Apartheid isn’t the reason the taps are dry.
Apartheid isn’t the reason Eskom is failing.
Apartheid isn’t the reason RDP houses are falling apart.
Corruption is.
And if we don’t fix it, the only thing we’ll ever get for free is more failure.


Chapter 14: How We Traded Lifelong Bonds for Temporary Transactions and Called It Progress

For most of human history, people didn’t rely on governments, corporations, or international charities for survival.
They relied on kinship.
They relied on close-knit communities.
They relied on people who had a permanent interest in their well-being.
This system worked not because people were kinder back then, but because they were logical.
You invested in your family because your family would always be there.
You helped your neighbor because you knew your neighbor would help you when you needed it.
You looked out for your community because your survival depended on it.
And most importantly:
You didn’t help just anyone.
You didn’t help a stranger passing through the village—you helped the people who were going to be there tomorrow.
When we helped strangers passing through it was because they earned our trust and gave us hope that if we were in the same position they would reciprocate.
You didn’t give money to someone who would take it and disappear—you invested in people you could hold accountable.
You didn’t waste resources on those who refused to contribute—you helped those who had proven they would give back.
This is why kinship-based support systems worked.
Blood ties are permanent.
Community ties are stable when immigration is low.
People help each other, knowing that the favor will be returned—not out of charity, but out of necessity.
Then, modernity arrived.
And suddenly, we were told that kinship was outdated, community was unnecessary, and that a government-run social welfare system was the “civilized” way to help people.
Now, here we are—with a society where people don’t even know their neighbors, but somehow, they’re forced to pay for their healthcare and housing.
At this point, we need to ask:
Did we really advance, or did we just turn personal responsibility into a government-funded Ponzi scheme?

Kinship-Based Help: The Original Social Security System
1. Family Support: The Most Reliable Investment
Kinship works because it has built-in accountability.
A father provides for his children, knowing that one day, those children will take care of him.
A sister helps her brother through hard times, knowing that he will do the same if she ever needs it.
A village supports a struggling family, knowing that this family will contribute once they recover.
Unlike government welfare, family support is not a one-way transaction.
There are no anonymous recipients.
There is no blind redistribution.
There is no risk that the recipient will disappear and never give back.
Because at the end of the day:
Blood doesn’t expire.
Even if your father is old and weak, he is still your father.
Even if your brother moves away, he is still your brother.
Even if you die, your descendants are still part of your family line.
This creates a system of obligations that lasts for generations.
Compare that to modern welfare systems, where the government takes your money and gives it to complete strangers—many of whom will never repay it, never contribute to society, and never even acknowledge the sacrifice you made.
At least in a family system, you know who you’re helping, why you’re helping them, and what they will do in return.
In a government system, you just fund an endless pit of welfare recipients with no accountability.

Community Support: Trust Over Transactions
Even outside of blood ties, tight-knit communities functioned on the same principles.
People invested in each other—not because they were kind, but because they had to.
If a man needed help building his house, his neighbors helped—knowing that he would do the same for them.
If a woman lost her husband, the community supported her—knowing she would contribute in other ways.
This worked because everyone had an interest in keeping the community stable.
Now? Communities barely exist.
People don’t even know their neighbors.
Towns and cities are full of strangers who have no loyalty to one another.
Instead of trusting each other, people trust government programs run by bureaucrats who don’t even live in their communities.
At this point, we replaced trust with transactions—and we wonder why society is falling apart.

How Modernity Replaced Kinship With Cold, Impersonal Transactions
Modern society told us that helping family and community members was “backward” and “limiting.”
Instead, they gave us:
Government Welfare


A system where taxpayers are forced to support strangers, with no guarantee that those strangers will ever contribute back.
No moral obligation, no social responsibility—just a government middleman taking money from one group and giving it to another.
Corporate Charity


Companies “donate” to causes—not because they care, but for PR.
They give billions to anonymous strangers instead of helping the people who actually make their businesses run.
Anonymous Giving


The rise of GoFundMe, disaster relief funds, and international aid has made people feel like they’re doing something—even though they’ll never see where the money actually goes.
And the biggest problem?
There is no accountability.
There is no obligation to contribute back.
There is no permanent bond between the giver and the receiver.
We were told this was progress.
But what we really did was turn human relationships into meaningless, short-term transactions.

The Debt We Owe Each Other: What David Graeber and Thomas Sowell Got Right
Anthropologist David Graeber explains in Debt: The First 5,000 Years that in traditional societies, debt was more than just money—it was about obligations, relationships, and reciprocity.
When someone helped you, you owed them—not in money, but in loyalty.
Debt wasn’t about immediate repayment—it was about long-term relationships.
Breaking your obligations meant breaking trust with your entire community.
Economist Thomas Sowell adds that functional societies operate on incentives.
People contribute because they know they will get something in return.
If you remove accountability, people stop contributing.
Welfare without responsibility destroys both the giver and the receiver.
Now, think about this in the context of modern taxation and welfare:
Taxpayers fund a welfare system that rewards failure, with no expectation of improvement.
Families no longer feel obligated to help each other—because “the government will do it.”
People who contribute the most are punished the most, while those who contribute nothing are rewarded.
And somehow, we call this progress.

What Can We Learn From This?
Kinship-based support systems work because they have built-in accountability.


You help those who will help you in return.
You don’t waste resources on people who refuse to contribute.
Communities thrive when people invest in those who will still be there tomorrow.


You don’t invest in strangers—you invest in your own.
Replacing kinship with government welfare has destroyed personal responsibility.


Now, people expect handouts with no effort.
Now, taxpayers are forced to support strangers they’ll never meet.
At some point, we need to stop pretending that this system works.
Because if we don’t fix it, we’ll end up with a society where nobody owes anyone anything—except taxes.
And right now?
That’s exactly where we’re headed.



Chapter 15: The Universal Paradox of Progress
We Were Promised a Lot…
“Modernization will make life easier!” (Yet somehow, we’re busier than ever.)
“Technology will set us free!” (But we’re more controlled than ever.)
“Government will take care of everything!” (And yet, nothing works properly.)
And here we are.
We have more education, but we’re dumber than ever.
We have more “freedom,” but we’re more restricted than ever.
We have more wealth, but we’re poorer than ever.
We have more convenience, but we’re more miserable than ever.
At some point, you have to stop and ask: Was it all worth it?
Because if progress really worked, shouldn’t we all be happier by now?

The Cycle of Civilization: Why We Keep Repeating History
History is funny. Every civilization follows the same cycle—and somehow, we never learn from it.
1️⃣ We start as self-sufficient tribes. Small, strong, and connected. Everyone plays a role. Life is tough, but meaningful.
 2️⃣ We build kingdoms and empires. We create rules, systems, and governments. Life gets easier.
 3️⃣ We develop massive bureaucracies. People stop providing for themselves. Government grows. People get lazy.
 4️⃣ We get too comfortable. We start focusing on luxury, convenience, and entertainment. We stop paying attention.
 5️⃣ Corruption spreads. The government stops working. The rich get richer. The poor get poorer.
 6️⃣ Collapse. The empire falls, and the cycle starts again.
From Ancient Rome to modern America, from the Zulu Kingdom to today’s South Africa, the same pattern repeats.
Every civilization thinks they’ve mastered progress, and every civilization eventually collapses under its own weight.
So here’s the real question:
Are we at step 5… or already at step 6?

The Irony of Modern Life
The more we “advanced,” the more we lost the things that actually made life good.
✅ We got formal education—but lost practical knowledge.
 ✅ We got democracy—but lost community leadership.
 ✅ We got welfare—but lost self-sufficiency.
 ✅ We got globalization—but lost culture.
 ✅ We got science—but somehow, we still believe influencers over actual facts.
Every “solution” created a new problem.
And the best part?
We keep calling it progress.

But Is It All Bad?
Before you think I’m saying, “Let’s go back to living in huts and hunting with spears,” relax.
Some things actually did improve:
✅ Medicine is better, sort of, until you're told to take a vaccine for something that barely affects you. At least we don’t die from simple infections anymore. (Though, considering modern hospital service, that might change—just ask the patients in the Eastern Cape hospitals where the ceilings are collapsing, or those in Tembisa where a whistleblower was assassinated for exposing corruption.)
✅ Communication is faster. We can talk to someone across the world instantly. (Yet, we’ve never felt more disconnected. The loneliest countries on Earth—Japan, South Korea, the UK—are also the most “developed.” Somehow, millions of people can talk instantly but still have no one to turn to.)
✅ Technology makes life easier. We don’t have to fetch water from a river or fight a lion for dinner. (Of course, that’s assuming technology actually works. And if you live in South Africa, Eskom ensures that’s never a guarantee.)
So, yes, progress has its benefits.
But here’s the catch:
When progress comes at the cost of meaning, community, and independence—does it still count as progress?
Because if you can have a house, a car, and an iPhone, but you’re still overworked, lonely, and miserable…
Are you really better off than your ancestors?

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World…
🏛 Rome Thought It Was Too Advanced to Fail—Then It Collapsed.
 The Roman Empire had roads, aqueducts, democracy, and a booming economy. Then they got lazy, corrupt, and obsessed with luxury. Sound familiar?
🌏 China Was the Most Advanced Civilization in the World—Then It Got Conquered.
 For centuries, China had the best technology, richest cities, and strongest economy. Then they got comfortable and ignored the rest of the world. Europe arrived with guns, and the rest is history.
🗽 America Said Capitalism Would Save Everyone—Now Half the Country Is in Debt.
 The "Land of Opportunity" became the land of student loans, medical debt, and a shrinking middle class. But hey, at least they have Netflix.
See the pattern yet?

So, What’s the Real Answer?
Maybe the secret isn’t choosing between modernity and tradition. 
After all, there is nothing so good no bad can come of it, just like there is nothing so bad it's devoid of any good.
Maybe the real solution is balance.
Imagine a world where:
✅ We have modern technology—but still grow our own food.
 ✅ We have education—but still learn practical skills.
 ✅ We have governments—but still solve problems as communities.
 ✅ We use electricity—but still know how to survive without it.
Because **progress is good—**but only if it doesn’t take away the things that actually matter.

The Final Question: Where Do We Go From Here?
We’re at a crossroads.
We can either:
❌ Keep pretending that everything is fine.
 ❌ Keep paying taxes for services that don’t work.
 ❌ Keep working ourselves to death, hoping it will all magically fix itself.
Or…
✅ Start thinking differently.
 ✅ Take the good from modern life without losing the wisdom of the past.
 ✅ Learn to be more self-sufficient.
 ✅ Take responsibility for our own communities.
 ✅ Stop waiting for governments to fix things, because they won’t.
History shows that civilizations rise and fall.
But maybe—just maybe—if we learn from the past, we won’t have to repeat it.

Final Thoughts: The Progress Paradox
This is the paradox of progress:
It promises freedom—but often creates dependence.
It makes life easier—but often makes people weaker.
It brings new solutions—but often creates new problems.
So, as we move forward, we must ask:
Are we truly progressing, or are we just running in circles, waiting for history to repeat itself?
The answer?
That’s up to us.











Epilogue: So… This Was Progress?

And here we are.
After centuries of colonization, segregation, struggle, and democracy, we were supposed to arrive at a utopia.
We were promised:
🚨 “Education will uplift everyone!” (Now we have PhD holders who can’t find jobs and high school dropouts who run billion-rand corruption schemes.)
🚨 “Democracy will give power to the people!” (Unless those people are taxpayers—then their only power is to keep paying for everything while the government delivers nothing.)
🚨 “The free market will bring prosperity!” (Unless, of course, you’re trying to start a business and get drowned in red tape, BEE policies, and taxes that punish success.)
🚨 “Modern life is better than ever!” (Tell that to the people stuck in traffic, living paycheck to paycheck, or trying to survive another Eskom blackout.)
So… was it all worth it?
That’s the paradox of progress. It gives, and it takes.
We got medicine, but we lost traditional healing.
We got modern jobs, but we lost self-sufficiency.
We got democracy, but we lost accountability.
We got technology, but we lost community.
And yet, after all these struggles, wars, and revolutions, we’re still left with the biggest question of all:
Are we actually better off than our ancestors?

But Don’t Worry—There’s More
This book is only the beginning of our journey through the paradox of progress.
In the next book—Civilized, Struggling, and Still Confused: The Side Effects of Progress—we’ll explore how democracy, globalization, and modern economics have left us with… well, let’s just say, "mixed results."
We’ll ask why the people who pay the most tax get the least benefits.
We’ll explore why crime is now treated as a social experiment rather than a punishable offense.
We’ll dive into how “modern” values have led to collapsing birth rates, loneliness epidemics, and the rise of self-help gurus who charge thousands to tell people the same advice their grandmothers used to give for free.
We’ll analyze how first-world countries—after forcing their systems on Africa—are now struggling with the same problems they told us they had solved.
And, of course, we’ll do it with the same satire, humor, and brutal honesty as this book.
Because if history has taught us one thing, it’s this:
🚨 Every civilization believes they’ve reached the peak of progress—until reality hits them in the face. 🚨

Final Thought: The Real Lesson of Progress
The truth is, progress isn’t always forward.
Sometimes, it’s sideways.
Sometimes, it’s two steps forward, three steps back.
Sometimes, it’s just a government official stealing the money that was supposed to fund it.
But at the end of the day, the real challenge is not rejecting progress—it’s deciding what progress actually means.
So, until the next book—keep questioning, keep thinking, and keep laughing.
Because if you don’t, the madness of modern life might just drive you crazy.

The End.

Notes

“The country lying between the present colonies of the Cape and Natal was first explored by Europeans in the year 1655, and was then found to be occupied by four great tribes, 
-the Amampondomsi,
the Amampondo,
the Abatembu,
and the Amaxosa,
who formed nations as distinct from each other as are the French and the Italians.

Their language was the same, and their laws and customs varied very slightly; but in all that respected government they were absolutely independent of one another.

It has since been ascertained that the tribes further northward do not differ materially from these.”

- George McCall Theal’s Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk Tales.
Preface.
Growing up in the former Transkei, as a Xhosa native, I believed I had a deep understanding of my heritage. I grew up surrounded, mostly by individuals who lived by the old ways, “AmaQaba”. I immersed myself in the customs and traditions of yore.

The rich traditions were enthusiastically passed down through storytelling sessions beneath the moonlit sky or by the flickering fire in a cosy, albeit occasionally smoky, rondavel, creating an unforgettable atmosphere. This was a time when mobile phones were rare, radios were luxuries, and televisions were almost nonexistent. I never tire of recounting the first time I saw a television set, or at least I thought I did only to be massively disappointed since the metal thing didn’t show any images, I was around 6 years old, mistaking the antenna on the roof for the television itself because I knew no better! 

While I did not actively seek knowledge about my lineage, the profound Xhosa roots that permeated every aspect of my environment captivated my attention. However, as I entered my teenage years and moved away from the Eastern Cape, my visits back home became infrequent. I began to miss out on the subtle intricacies of our ancestral rituals and norms.

My hopes of delving deeper into written records were shattered by the scarcity and inaccessibility of books that detailed the historical evolution of the Xhosa people, whose roots can be traced back to Central and East Africa.

The biggest shock came when I read George McCall Theal’s Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk Tales. It was the first time I got an understanding of the diverse tribes present in the Xhosa community. Until then I thought all the tribes under the Xhosa nation were subgroups, with Xhosa always having existed as a nation, nothing could be further from the truth!

AmaXhosa existed as one of many tribes who were Xhosa speaking around the now Eastern Cape region of South Africa. Each tribe has its own individual identity that predates King Hintsa ka Khawuta's assimilation of the Eastern Cape tribes into the Xhosa nation from 1820 to 1835. I had never realized that Xhosa had not always been a collective name for these tribes and that they were once separate entities. As a homeschooling father, my ignorance deeply affected me.

Then there is the common ancestry between native Africans that predates the Xhosa, Zulu, Ndebele, Swazi nations in our common ancestor Mnguni. Within us all as South African Bantu tribes we have common ancestors that predates even our Nguni  ancestors from our immigration through central African from common roots. 

I am acutely aware of the irony behind the fact that the idea for this book originated from the son of a Canadian doctor who briefly lived in the United States and Sierra Leone before settling in South Africa in the 1800s. It is equally important to recognize that as I delved into my family's history, I relied heavily on technologies that are a result of the initial encounters, conflicts, but most importantly, the collaboration and lasting coexistence between my ancestors and the Western explorers of that time. Above all, these details aim to symbolize the interconnectedness among us as human beings, regardless of surface disparities, historical origins, and locations.

We can choose to amplify our differences to justify conflict between us as people, but common lineage did not prevent internal conflicts between the Bantu which led to the nations, tribes and clans we have, not only in South Africa but throughout Africa. Neither did it prevent Romulus from killing Remus despite him being his brother. Common descent even in Indian mythology rather than contribute to unity, it was the justification for the India's Caste System. Regardless of whether one embraces the scientific explanation for humanity's origins, linking all humans and life to a shared ancestor, or religious creation myths that often attribute our beginnings to a common creator, it is clear that common descent has not ensured reliable coexistence and cooperation.

The research I conducted for this book took me on an unforgettable journey through history. It reinforced to me a valuable lesson: that despite our diverse backgrounds, as South Africans, we have way more incentives to come together and strive mutually for survival and success than the alternatives. Our individuality, more than hindering our progress, has been enriching our collective experience if all things are considered.

Realizing my lack of knowledge, I understood that I need to educate myself before trying to educate my children and family. As “The Homeschooling Father”, I homeschool not only because I love teaching my kids, but also because I love learning myself. This realization prompted me to embark on a journey of discovery, which ultimately led me to create this book.

Needless to say, while conducting my research, I uncovered a wealth of information. However, this book only attempts to touch on the most significant aspects. I plan to explore further as part of this series, which will encompass not only the Xhosa nation but also the diverse nations in South Africa, from Zulu to Indian, Afrikaans and Venda, English and Pedi, Tswana and Tsonga, Swati, Sotho and Ndebele, and everyone in between.



Chapter 1: The Bantu Migration and Early Origins of the Xhosa People.



The Bantu Expansion from Central Africa.

"Clans are groups of families with different surnames but sharing one clan name. For example, 
Radebe is the clan, but the nation is called amaHlubi. 

The clan name is the name of the first ancestor or family that gave birth to the clan.

Clans make up tribes and tribes make up Nations."

SouthAfrica.net




The Xhosa people, as part of the Nguni and a subset of the Bantu, have a rich and complex history. Originating from Central Africa, the Bantu migration, characterized by shared languages and cultural customs, led to the eventual settlement of the Xhosa nation predominantly in the Eastern Cape.

This movement, which began over two millennia ago, was driven by population growth, the pursuit of arable land, and economic opportunities.

During their southward migration, the Bantu encountered the Khoisan people, resulting in cultural exchange and blending that significantly influenced the formation of the Xhosa identity. The subsequent development of distinct tribal groups within the Xhosa nation further illustrates the diversity and richness of their heritage.

Furthermore, the 16th century separation from the Zulu, stemming from political and territorial disputes, led to the establishment of individual Xhosa tribes. Despite this division, the Xhosa and the Zulu maintain a shared heritage and language, isiXhosa, symbolizing strong connections to other Bantu languages in Central Africa.

Certainly, the Xhosa people's commitment to preserving their cultural and linguistic heritage, from their Bantu origins to their interactions with the Khoisan and subsequent divergence from the Zulu, is a testament to their resilience and pride.

1.1 Arrival and Interaction with the Khoisan People.
As Bantu speakers, they gradually moved southward, settling in what is now known as the Eastern Cape province. It was during this migration that the Xhosa people came into contact with the Khoisan, the indigenous inhabitants of the region. The interaction between the Xhosa and the Khoisan was a significant chapter in the Xhosa people's history. 

The Khoisan, known for their unique language, culture, and hunter-gatherer lifestyle, had inhabited the region for thousands of years before the arrival of the Bantu-speaking Xhosa. This encounter shaped the Xhosa people's culture, language, and social dynamics, leading to a fusion of the two communities. The Xhosa and the Khoisan exchanged ideas, knowledge, and practices, resulting in a rich cultural tapestry. 

The Xhosa people adopted elements of the Khoisan language, integrating it into their own linguistic heritage. They also learned from the Khoisan's hunting and gathering techniques, adapting them to their agricultural practices. However, the relationship between the Xhosa and the Khoisan was not always harmonious. Tensions arose as the Xhosa population grew and their demand for land increased. 

This led to conflicts over territory and resources, which affected the dynamics between the two groups.

The impact of the Khoisan on the Xhosa people is so profound that even the name Xhosa is said to have come from the Khoisan language, directly translated to mean “angry men”. As you can guess this was not given in affection but rather as a result of conflicts between the people who would later be Xhosa and the Khoisan. After the Khoisan hunted domesticated cattle of the people that would later be named Xhosa conflict ensued between the two, amongst other things resulting in the Xhosa name.

1.2 Early Settlements and Tribes in the Eastern Cape.
As the Xhosa people settled in the Eastern Cape, they established various tribes that would become integral to their identity. These tribes include the amaMpondo, amaMpondomise, amaMfengu, amaJwarha, amaQwathi, amaBhaca, amaXesibe, amaBomvana, amaMbalu, amaNdlambe, amaNtinde, amaHlubi, amaZizi, amaVundle, amaGcaleka, amaNgqika, amaThembu and others . 

Each tribe had its own distinct culture, customs, and leadership structures, but they all shared a common ancestry and language. 


farmer which he is now enjoying. Even now, he continues to be the most influential man I have ever had the honor of knowing, second only to my father.

The Xaba clan's name is derived from the Zulu word "ubaba," which means father. They are closely related to the Xhosa nation through their association with the amaRharhabe royal house, which is an esteemed position within the Xhosa kingship. 

The AmaRharhabe royal house was founded by Prince Rharhabe, the son of King Phalo, who ruled the Xhosa nation in the 18th century. Prince Rharhabe and his followers settled beyond the Kei River and established their own kingdom, interacting with various tribes and clans, including the Xaba clan. Over time, the Xaba clan became allies and subjects of the amaRharhabe royal house. They adopted many Xhosa customs and traditions, cementing their connection to the royal lineage. Today, the Xaba clan remains an integral part of the amaRharhabe royal house, recognizing the authority and leadership of the Xhosa king. 

The Gcaleka tribe traces its lineage back to the famous Chief Phalo, who was the progenitor of the Xhosa nation. The Ngqika tribe, on the other hand, was renowned for its fierce resistance against colonial rule and played a significant role in the Xhosa Wars of the 19th Century. The Eastern Cape region became a melting pot of Xhosa culture, with each tribe contributing its unique traditions and practices. The Xhosa people developed a rich oral tradition, passing down their history, folklore, and values through storytelling, praise songs, and proverbs. 

Understanding the early settlements and clans in the Eastern Cape is crucial to comprehending the historical origins of the Xhosa people. It sheds light on their journey from Central Africa as Bantu, their interactions with the Khoisan, and their eventual split from the Zulu. This knowledge is not only significant for history lovers but also for Xhosa people and South Africans as a whole, as it contributes to a deeper understanding of the diverse cultural tapestry that makes up the nation. 

The Eastern Cape holds a treasure trove of history and cultural heritage, particularly regarding the early settlements and groups of the Xhosa people. Exploring this chapter of history allows us to appreciate the historical origins of the Xhosa people, their interactions with the Khoisan, and their eventual splitting into various tribes. By unravelling the complex tapestry of Xhosa history, we gain a deeper appreciation for the diverse cultural heritage of South Africa and the contributions of the Xhosa people to its rich historical narrative.
Chapter 2: Xhosa-Khoisan Relations and Interactions.


Cultural Exchange and Adaptation.

“Their most formidable foes were the San, a group of hunter gathers. The San believed that their God had given all the animals in the world for them to hunt and this included the cattle of the Chobona. 

They hunted the herds of domesticated cattle until the Chobona got angry. This lead to a bloody conflict that resulted in the crushing of the weaker San groups and the abduction of San and Khoi Khoi women and young men to serve as wives and warriors in Xhosa society. 

The San appalled at their greed and lack of generosity with their animals named these new tall and dark strangers the Xhosa: the angry men. This name stuck to Umnguni’s oldest son and he was known through the land as umXhosa the angriest of the Chobona.”
Mbuyiselo Klaas, Umzi kaPhalo	


Throughout history, the identity and heritage of the Xhosa people of South Africa have been profoundly shaped by cultural exchange and adaptation. It was enthralling to uncover, during a trip to Namibia twenty years ago, the far-reaching presence of the Xhosa people beyond the borders of South Africa, with communities extending into neighboring countries like Lesotho. Magriza can cook, a YouTube channel showcases “AmaXhosa AseZimbabwe: A Unique Cultural Experience!”.

Intermarriage played a significant role in the remarkable integration of Khoikhoi customs into the Xhosa culture. The way this would happen is that Khoikhoi individuals would marry Xhosa individuals, and vise versa, creating bonds between the two communities and facilitating cultural exchange. As a result, aspects of Khoikhoi traditions and practices became integrated into Xhosa society, enriching their cultural fabric.

The integration of the Khoisan click sounds into the Xhosa language stands out as a key aspect of this cultural exchange, setting Xhosa communication apart from other Bantu languages. 

Beyond language the Xhosa people also adopted certain musical instruments and styles from the Khoikhoi, such as the mouth bow and certain dances. Additionally, the Khoikhoi's pastoralist lifestyle and knowledge of herding and tending livestock may have influenced the Xhosa people's own practices. Moreover, the Xhosa people readily integrated the Khoikhoi's extensive understanding of plants and traditional medicinal techniques into their own healing rituals and remedies. This cultural interchange cultivated a diverse array of traditions and customs within the Xhosa community, showcasing the interdependence and common heritage of indigenous peoples across Southern Africa.

The encounter with other Bantu-speaking groups, particularly the Zulu, upon settling in the former Transkei, now known as the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, sparked further cultural exchange, leading to the development of unique customs and traditions within different Xhosa subgroups.

It is for this reason that there are a lot of commonalities between Xhosa and Zulu customs and traditions. Both cultures share similar linguistic and cultural practices, which have been influenced by their shared history and geographical proximity. Many of the traditional beliefs and rituals in Xhosa and Zulu cultures are deeply rooted in their shared Bantu heritage and have been passed down through generations. This has resulted in a strong sense of interconnectedness and mutual understanding between the two cultures.

The diversity within the Xhosa community is a testament to their adaptability and resilience as they navigated the intricate dynamics of cultural exchange and adaptation.

2.1. Conflicts and wars with the Khoisan.
The wars between the Xhosa and the Khoisan in South Africa were mainly caused by competition for land and resources. The colonial expansion of the Dutch and British powers in the Eastern Cape region also played a role. The Xhosa were agricultural and pastoral, while the Khoisan were hunter gatherers and nomads. These differences led to alliances and conflicts. The Xhosa often fought against the Zulu and the British, while the Khoisan sometimes sided with the Dutch and the British against the Xhosa. 

A conflict between the Xhosa and the Khoisan happened in 1779 when the Xhosa invaded the area where the Khoisan lived. This sparked the First Cape Frontier War, which lasted until 1781.

The Xhosa and the Khoisan clashed again in the Third Cape Frontier War (1799–1801), when the Khoisan rebelled against the Dutch and joined forces with the Xhosa. The Fourth Cape Frontier War (1811–1812) ended with the British driving the Xhosa out of the area and taking control. 

As the Xhosa and the Khoisan faced British colonial invasion, they sometimes cooperated and supported each other in resisting the British, especially during the Sixth Cape Frontier War (1834–1835) and the Eighth Cape Frontier War (1850–1853). However, there were also internal divisions and conflicts among the Xhosa and the Khoisan, as some collaborated with the British or the Boers. Ultimately, both groups lost their land and independence to the British, who annexed their territories and incorporated them into the Cape Colony.

2.2 Influence on Xhosa social structure and beliefs.
The Khoikhoi were the pioneering pastoralists in Southern Africa, introducing the notion of cattle as a symbol of wealth and status to the Xhosa. The Xhosa adopted the Khoikhoi tradition of Lobola, or bride wealth, which involved offering cattle to the bride's family as a means of compensation and alliance.

Additionally, the Khoikhoi shared religious beliefs and rituals with the Xhosa, including the belief in a supreme being called uThixo or uNkulunkulu, and the honoring of ancestors through sacrifices and ceremonies. From the Khoikhoi, the Xhosa learned the use of divination bones and herbs to connect with the spirit world and heal diseases.

Both the Khoikhoi and the Xhosa shared a common origin in the Nguni language family and influenced each other's languages over time. The Xhosa language incorporated click sounds and words from the Khoikhoi language, particularly for place names, animal names, and loanwords. In turn, the Khoikhoi language also adopted some words and grammatical structures from the Xhosa language.

Chapter 3: Xhosa-Zulu Relations and the Split into Different Xhosa tribes.


"The manner in which the Kaffirs became divided into independent tribes in ancient times is clearly shown by the law of succession to the chieftainship which is in force to the present day. 

The first wives of a chief are usually the daughters of some of his father's principal retainers; but as he increases in power his alliance is courted by great families, and thus it generally happens that the last of his wives is the highest in rank. Probably she is the daughter of a neighbouring chief, for it is indispensable in her case that the blood of the ruling line should flow in her veins. 

She is termed the great wife, and her eldest son is the principal heir. 
Another of his wives is invested at some period of his life, with the consent of his councillors and friends, with the title of wife of the right hand, and to her eldest son is allotted a portion of the tribe, with which he forms a new clan."

- George McCall Theal’s Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk Tales


Historical ties between the Xhosa and Zulu.
The Xhosa and Zulu people share a common ancestry, and for centuries, they coexisted harmoniously in what is now known as South Africa. It was during the rise of the Zulu Kingdom under the legendary King Shaka that tensions began to emerge between the two groups. 

The Xhosa people, led by their own chiefs and kings, eventually decided to break away from the Zulu Kingdom and establish their own independent communities. This development was also influenced by inter-clan conflicts, population growth, and the need for new sources of food and grazing    land. The leadership of prominent chiefs and the formation of alliances or rivalries with neighbouring groups played a significant role in shaping the Xhosa tribes. As a result, various Xhosa tribes developed distinct identities, traditions, and territories over time, contributing to the diversity within the Xhosa culture. 

The Xhosa split from the Zulu and the formation of different Xhosa tribes is believed to have occurred in the 16th century. It was influenced by a mixture of social, political, and economic factors. The Xhosa people migrated southwards from the Great Lakes region and settled in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. This split gave rise to various Xhosa tribes. 

The Mfecane or "Time of Crushing" in the early 19th century further fueled the disintegration of the Xhosa clans. This period of upheaval resulted in further fragmentation and the emergence of new groups. These new groups often formed as a result of the movement and displacement caused by the Mfecane, leading to a reshuffling of territorial boundaries and the formation of new alliances. 

The amaXhosa were one of many groups that had to adapt to the changing landscape and power dynamics during this tumultuous period. Despite the challenges, they managed to carve out their own place in the evolving social and political landscape of the region. 

One of the key figures in the formation of the amaXhosa was Chief Ngqika, who played a crucial role in uniting various Xhosa-speaking clans under a common banner. Under his leadership, the amaXhosa began to establish themselves as a formidable force in the region, challenging other rival groups and defending their Territory. They also developed strategies for coping with the changing environment, including a heightened emphasis on military prowess and diplomatic negotiations with neighbouring groups. 

This period marked a pivotal moment in the history of the AmaXhosa as they solidified their presence and influence in the region. Despite being separated, the Xhosa and Zulu people have maintained a strong cultural connection throughout history, which continues to this day. The Xhosa people, in particular, have preserved their oral traditions, storytelling, and rituals, which often reflect their historical ties to the Zulu.

3.1. Factors leading to the split.
One of the key factors that contributed to the split was the geographical expansion of the Xhosa people. As they migrated southwards, they encountered different landscapes, climate, and resources. These variations played a significant role in shaping the cultural and social dynamics of the Xhosa people. With the diverse environments they settled in, the Xhosa gradually developed distinct customs, traditions, and even dialects, leading to a natural division within the community. 

Another factor that led to the split was the influence of neighbouring groups. Over time, the Xhosa people interacted and intermingled with various communities, particularly the Khoisan people. The intermarriage and cultural exchange between the Xhosa and the Khoisan contributed to the formation of distinct subgroups within the Xhosa community. The mixing of different languages, customs, and belief systems further reinforced the development of unique identities within the Xhosa people.

Additionally, political and leadership differences played a significant role in the split of the Xhosa people. As the Xhosa society expanded, the need for effective governance became crucial. Different subgroups began to develop their own leadership structures and systems. Disagreements and conflicts over power and authority eventually led to the formation of separate factions, each with their own leaders. This division further solidified the separate identities and subgroups within the Xhosa community.

Furthermore, external influences such as colonisation and the arrival of European settlers also played a role in the Xhosa split. The intrusion of foreign powers disrupted the social and political dynamics of the Xhosa people. 

The Xhosa communities had to navigate through the complexities of colonial rule and European encroachment, resulting in further fragmentation and division within the Xhosa society. The split of the Xhosa people from the Zulu can be attributed to a combination of geographical, cultural, political, and external factors. The Xhosa people's journey from Central Africa to South Africa, their interactions with different ethnic groups, and the challenges posed by colonisation all contributed to the diversification and eventual split of the Xhosa community. Understanding these factors is essential in unravelling the rich and complex history of the Xhosa people and their contribution to the diverse tapestry of South African heritage.


3.2. Historical Conflicts and Wars between the Xhosa and the Zulu.
The Xhosa and Zulu peoples experienced conflicts that led to their separation and subsequent wars. These disputes were mainly caused by territorial disagreements, cattle raids, competition over resources, and power struggles. Furthermore, the tensions between these powerful African ethnic groups were fueled by political ambitions and leadership rivalries. Various kings and chiefs sought to expand their influence, resulting in increased friction and hostilities between the Xhosa and Zulu. 

Below is a brief summary of some major conflicts between the Xhosa and Zulu at that time; 

In the late 1700s and early 1800s, the Zulu chiefdom, under the leadership of Shaka Zulu, successfully expanded its territory and power. Shaka implemented military and political reforms, which led to conflicts with neighbouring chiefdoms, including the Xhosa, who resisted his invasions.

In 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half-brothers, Dingane and Mhlangana, who took control of the Zulu kingdom. Dingane attempted to maintain Shaka's legacy but faced challenges from internal rivals and external enemies such as the Xhosa, Boers, and the British.

In 1835, Dingane dispatched an army to attack the Xhosa chiefdom of Hintsa, who had formed an alliance with the British against the Zulu. However, the combined forces of the Xhosa and British defeated the Zulu army. Hintsa was captured and killed by the British.

In 1840, Dingane was overthrown by his half-brother, Mpande, who became the new Zulu king. Mpande aimed to avoid conflicts with the Xhosa, Boers, and British and focused on consolidating his rule and expanding his population.

In 1856, a young Xhosa girl named Nongqawuse claimed to have received a prophecy from ancestors. She instructed the Xhosa people to kill their cattle and destroy their crops in exchange for an abundant new world free from their enemies. Many Xhosa people followed Nongqawuse's instructions, leading to a devastating famine and social collapse, known as the Cattle Killing Movement. Taking advantage of the Xhosa's weakness, the Zulu king Mpande raided their lands, capturing cattle and people.

In 1879, the British Empire declared war on the Zulu kingdom with the goal of annexing it to their Natal colony. The war, known as the Anglo-Zulu War, lasted for six months and resulted in the defeat and fragmentation of the Zulu kingdom. While the Xhosa people, who had been under British rule since 1857, did not directly participate in the war, some sympathised with the Zulu's resistance.

In 1884, a Zulu prince named Dinuzulu claimed the Zulu throne with support from a group of Boer mercenaries. These mercenaries sought to gain land and influence in Zululand. However, Dinuzulu's claim was opposed by the British, who had divided Zululand into several smaller chiefdoms, as well as by his Zulu rivals competing for the throne. Dinuzulu engaged in a series of battles against his enemies but was ultimately captured and exiled by the British in 1889.



3.3. Shared customs and beliefs between the Xhosa and the Zulu nations.
Despite the historical divide, the shared lineage and enduring traditions that have surpassed conflicts and stood the test of time still unite the two nations to this day. The similarities between the Xhosa and Zulu cultures far outweigh their differences even to date, symbolizing the historical ties.

From a language perspective, the Xhosa and the Zulu languages are closely related, and they both belong to the Nguni language family. They have similar vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, but they also have some differences, such as the number of click sounds and the tone system indicating the Khoisan influence on the Xhosa.

Shared customs between the Xhosa and Zulu nations include initiation ceremonies, respect for ancestors, oral traditions, and the use of traditional medicines. Both cultures place great importance on initiation rituals, where young boys or girls transition into adulthood through various rites of passage.

Ancestor reverence is also prominent in both societies, with beliefs in the spiritual connection with deceased family members.

Oral traditions, including storytelling, praise songs, riddles, legends and proverbs, are integral to the cultural heritage of both the Xhosa and Zulu people. They also have various forms of music and dance, such as isicathamiya, maskandi, and gumboot dance. They use musical instruments, such as drums, flutes, horns, and string instruments, such as the uhadi.

Furthermore, traditional medicine plays a significant role in healing and wellness practices, incorporating the use of herbs, rituals, and spiritual guidance.

These shared customs reflect the rich cultural heritage and traditions of these two nations.
Chapter 4: The Xhosa nation, from the common ancestors to the unification under the Xhosa banner.


The foundations of the Xhosa nation, from Mnguni I.

“First of all, people must know the use of the term “Mfengu” (translated as “Fingo” in English) is an insult and there is no nation called AmamMfengu.

What happened is that during migration from Thukela, a certain group of AbaMbo arrived in Butterworth in 1828. When they were asked by Zanzolo who they were, they said: “SingAbaMbo, siyamfenguza sifuna umhlaba” (“We are AbaMbo, we are destitute, we are looking for land”).

That was the beginning of the use of the term “mfengu”, meaning “the destitute” and in the Bantu history there was never a nation called “The Destitutes”.”

The origins of the Xhosa nation can be traced back to Mnguni, with Tshawe, a direct descendant of Mnguni, being honored as the founder of the Xhosa nation after conquering the Cirha and Jwarha groups to establish the Xhosa kingdom. Cirha, the son of Xhosa and the grandson of Mnguni II, founded the amaCirha clan, one of the sub-groups of the Xhosa nation. 

His son Tshawe, who went on to defeat the Cirha and Jwarha groups, became the founder of the Xhosa kingdom. His successors expanded the kingdom's influence by settling in new territories and bringing the inhabitants under the authority of the amaTshawe, normally adopting the name of the chief under whom they had unified.

Hintsa is a descendant of Phalo ka Tshiwo, he went on to unit the different tribes under the Xhosa nation. 

4.1 The formation of the different tribes
There are many tribes under the Xhosa nation, most of which predate even the unification under the Xhosa nation. Below are some of them, this list is not exhaustive by any means. 

4.1.1 The Gcaleka Tribe
The Gcaleka Tribe history takes a significant turn with their split from the Zulu. This division occurred during the reign of King Phalo, the revered ancestor of the Xhosa people. The first time I heard of the legendary King was through greetings “Mzi ka Phalo”, which directly translates to House of Phalo signifying his contribution. 

Dissatisfied with the Zulu leadership, the Gcaleka, along with other Xhosa groups, made the decision to forge their own path, leading to the formation of distinct clans such as Bhaca, Ngqika, Thembu, Mpondomise, Mfengu, Mpondo, and Bomvana.The Gcaleka Tribe, under the leadership of Chief Gcaleka, emerged as one of the most prominent and powerful clans within the Xhosa nation. 

They established their stronghold in the Eastern Cape, becoming custodians of the land and defenders of their people. The Gcaleka Tribe played a pivotal role in the struggles against colonial forces, resisting encroachment and fighting to preserve their autonomy and traditions. 

Today, the Gcaleka people, along with other Xhosa Tribes, continue to honour their rich heritage and contribute to the vibrant tapestry of South African society. Their unique cultural practices, language, and traditional beliefs serve as a testament to their resilience and spirit.

4.1.2 Creation of the Bhaca Tribe
Among the clans that emerged from the Xhosa-Zulu split, the Bhaca Tribe holds a prominent place. Led by Chief Bhaca, they embarked on a journey of resilience and determination that shaped their unique destiny within the Xhosa nation. The Bhaca people settled in the rugged terrains of the Eastern Cape, adapting to their environment and cultivating a close connection with the land. 

The Bhaca Tribe is renowned for their deep-rooted cultural practices, including their distinctive attire, music, dance, and oral traditions. Their rich mythology, storytelling, and spiritual beliefs form an integral part of the Xhosa cultural tapestry, contributing to the preservation and celebration of their unique Heritage. 

The Bhaca Tribe has left an indelible mark on the Xhosa nation. Their warriors, known for their bravery and military prowess, played a vital role in shaping the region's history. They defended their lands against external threats and played a significant role in the resistance against colonial rule. 

Today, the Bhaca people continue to contribute to the socio-economic development of South Africa, excelling in various fields and upholding their cultural legacy. The creation of the Bhaca Tribe stands as a testament to the resilience and unwavering spirit of the Xhosa people. Their journey from Central Africa to South Africa, their encounter with the Khoisan, and their split from the Zulu kingdom highlight the complexity and diversity of their History.

4.1.3. Emergence of theNgqika Tribe.
The Ngqika Tribe, led by Chief Ngqika, emerged as one of the prominent factions during this period of political upheaval. Chief Ngqika was known for his strong leadership and strategic alliances, which allowed the Ngqika Tribe to assert its influence in the region. 

They played a crucial role in resisting the colonial expansion of the British and Dutch settlers, fighting to protect their land and preserve their cultural heritage. The Ngqika Tribe's history is intertwined with the broader struggles of the Xhosa people against colonialism and oppression. They faced numerous challenges, including land dispossession, forced labour, and cultural assimilation. 

Despite these hardships, the Ngqika Tribe and other Xhosa subgroups have managed to preserve their distinct identities and traditions.Today, the Ngqika Tribe continues to play an important role within the Xhosa community and South African society as a whole. Their history serves as a reminder of the resilience and perseverance of the Xhosa people in the face of adversity. 

By understanding the emergence of the Ngqika Tribe, we gain valuable insights into the historical origins of the Xhosa people and their ongoing quest for self determination and cultural pride. This subchapter is dedicated to all history lovers, Xhosa people, and South Africans who seek a deeper understanding of the historical origins of the Xhosa people and the rich tapestry of their diverse subgroups. It aims to provide a comprehensive account of the emergence of the Ngqika Tribe within the broader context of Xhosa history, shedding light on their contributions, struggles, and triumphs throughout the centuries.

4.1.4. Founding of the Thembu Tribe.
The Xhosa people were initially united under a strong central authority, led by a king or paramount chief. However, internal conflicts and external pressures eventually led to the fragmentation of the Xhosa into several distinct clans. One of these clans was the Thembu. 

Ngubengcuka was known for his wise leadership and diplomatic skills. He was able to navigate the complex political landscape of the time, forging alliances and negotiating with both the British colonisers and rival Xhosa Tribe. Under his rule, the Thembu Tribe flourished, becoming one of the most influential and respected clans in Xhosa society. 

Today, the Thembu people continue to maintain a strong sense of cultural identity and pride in their history. They have made significant contributions to South African society, with prominent figures such as Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu being members of the Thembu Tribe. The founding of the Thembu Tribe is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the Xhosa people. 

It highlights the complex historical origins of the Xhosa, from their migration from Central Africa as Bantu, their interactions with the Khoisan, and their eventual split from the Zulu. Understanding the founding of the Thembu Tribe is crucial in unravelling the rich tapestry of Xhosa history, and it serves as a reminder of the diverse and interconnected nature of South Africa's cultural heritage.

4.1.5. Establishment Tribe of the Mpondomise.
The Mpondomise Tribe, led by Chief Mpondombini, emerged as one of the prominent factions following the split. They settled in the lush and fertile lands of the Eastern Cape, where they established their own distinct community. 

The Mpondomise people became known for their agricultural prowess, cultivating crops such as maize and millet, which not only sustained their own community but also contributed to the broader Xhosa economy. Throughout their existence, the Mpondomise Tribe faced numerous challenges, including conflicts with neighbouring clans and the encroachment of European colonisers. 

Despite these obstacles, the Mpondomise people remained resilient and steadfast in preserving their cultural heritage. They continued to pass down their traditional customs, oral histories, and rituals from one generation to the next, ensuring the survival of their unique identity. Today, the Mpondomise Tribe stands as a testament to the rich history and cultural diversity of the Xhosa people. 

Their distinct traditions, beliefs, and contributions continue to shape the tapestry of South African society. As history lovers, Xhosa people, and South Africans, we must cherish and celebrate the establishment of the Mpondomise Tribe as a crucial milestone in the Xhosa people's journey from Central Africa to South Africa.

4.1.6. Origins of the Mfengu Tribe.
I have vivid memories of a childhood friend from eDrayini, who used to speak passionately about visiting his relatives in "emaMfengwini", referring to the place of the Mfengus. Back then, this held little significance for me, but recently everything fell into place. Given that Drayini is a rural village under Dutywa, Zola's reference to emaMfengwini indicated a location towards Butterworth. When considering the historical background of the Mfengu, everything now falls into place.

In 1828, a group of AbaMbo sought refuge in Butterworth, escaping the tumult of the Mfecane. Hailing from the Thukela River valley in present-day KwaZulu-Natal, they were part of the Nguni group of Bantu-speaking people.

Their settlement in the Ciskei and Transkei regions allowed them to prosper as farmers and traders. They embraced Christianity and Western education, producing some of the earliest political leaders among the Cape Africans. Today, they are an integral part of South African society, boasting a diverse and prosperous history and culture. While some have integrated into the Xhosa nation, others have maintained their unique identity and autonomy.

The journey of the Mfengu tribe is punctuated by numerous obstacles and opportunities in the modern era. A key challenge they face is their intricate relationship with the Xhosa, who are both their kin and former adversaries. Some have assimilated into the Xhosa community, while others proudly uphold their distinct identity and autonomy.

Their struggle for land and political rights has been an enduring battle against apartheid, the Bantustan system, and the post-apartheid government. While some have advocated for their own homeland, others have pursued integration within democratic South Africa, striving for fair representation.

Furthermore, the social and economic progress of the Mfengu tribe has been shaped by their unique historical legacy, cultural values, and present-day challenges. While some have achieved remarkable success and recognition in various fields, others continue to grapple with poverty and marginalization.

The Mfengu tribe, with its diverse and rich heritage, significantly enriches the complexity and vibrancy of South African society. They have played a pivotal role in shaping the history and politics of the region, leaving an indelible mark on the nation's tapestry.

4.1.7. Development of the Mpondo Tribes.
The interaction between the Xhosa and the Khoisan had a significant impact on the development of the Mpondo Tribe. This cultural fusion contributed to the distinct identity of the Mpondo Tribe. 

After their defeat at the hands of the renowned Zulu leader Shaka, the Mpondo tribe experienced immense turmoil and displacement. The period of Mfecane brought about significant challenges for the Mpondo people, as they were forced to migrate and their community fragmented. They struggled to cope with the loss of their land and traditional way of life. Many Mpondo communities were scattered across different regions, which made it difficult to maintain their unity and tribal identity.

However, in 1828, under the leadership of the great Faku, the Mpondo people found a way to reorganize and rise again, despite their previous hardships. Faku demonstrated remarkable insight by learning from history and adopting some of the successful war strategies used by Shaka's army, which had previously led to their downfall. As a result, the Mpondo people flourished under Faku's leadership.

By 1860, their population had grown to around 100,000, and they had become a formidable state with the ability to engage in trade with European traders during the 1860s.

Unfortunately, the Mpondo people would face further challenges and ultimately succumb to Cecil Rhodes, largely due to internal conflicts within their own groups, which weakened them. Despite these setbacks, the Mpondo people exhibited incredible bravery as they persevered and adapted to their new circumstances. They tenaciously held onto their cultural heritage, preserving their language, customs, and traditional practices, which played a vital role in keeping their community alive amid the chaos of displacement.

4.1.8. Formation of the Bomvana Tribe.
As a member of the Tshezi clan, I trace my roots to the Bomvana tribe. "Tshezi, Jalamba, Mqal’ ongangenduku, Njilo-njilo, iNkonjane emnyama ebhab’ emafini, iinzwana zakwaBomvana, iNyoka emnyama ecanda isiziba, inkosi ezingazange zibutheng’ubokhosi Zinto ezityhafileyo ingathi zidla umcuku. " These are just some of the praises we recite when recounting our history through the practice of "ukuzithutha". 

I never understood much about why we went through all the names we do until I saw that amongst my ancestors, Njilo is one, hence the emphasis and repeated praise in "Njilo Njilo". Bomovana is highly praised in the process as well signifying the link.. 

AmaBomvana were forced out of Pondoland and settled in the area east of the Mbashe river. They formed a relationship with the Gcaleka and received permission from King Hintsa. 

They have a historical connection with other groups like AmaMpondomise, AmaXesibe, AbakwaMkhize, and AmaMpondo, as they share cultural similarities.



4.2. Hintsa ka Khawuta: The Great King of the Xhosa Nation
Hintsa ka Khawuta, or King Hintsa, was the great of the Xhosa Kingdom, originally founded by his great ancestor, King Tshawe. His reign, from 1820 until 1835, saw the Xhosa Kingdom at its pinnacle, stretching from the Mbhashe River in the south of Mthatha to the Gamtoos River in the Southern Cape. Hintsa oversaw one of the most formidable kingdoms in Southern Africa, eventually engaging in a century-long conflict with the British Empire and their expansion across the region.

The Xhosa Kingdom was governed by two houses, the Gcaleka House or Great House, serving as the ruling house, and the Rharhabe House or right-hand house, as the second senior house. During Hintsa's reign, tributary states such as AbaThembu, AmaMpondo, AmaBomvana, AmaBhaca, and AmaMpondomise acknowledged the authority of the Xhosa Kingdom. These states, although ethnically Xhosa, maintained their autonomy within the kingdom.

Born around 1780, Hintsa was the son of Khawuta ka Gcaleka, descending from a long line of notable rulers. He succeeded his uncle Nqoko ka Gcaleka, the regent king, and was officially crowned in 1820. Hintsa is often compared to his remarkable great-ancestor, Tshawe kaNkosiyamntu, who founded the Xhosa kingdom in the late 17th century by defeating rival groups. Hintsa inherited a prosperous and sizable kingdom, which he skillfully maintained and fortified using his diplomacy and military expertise. His people held him in high regard, and his influence extended beyond his own kingdom to other African kingdoms and chiefs. Even his adversaries, such as the British and the Boers, recognized his authority and respected his strength.

Under Hintsa's leadership, the Xhosa army was one of the largest and most formidable in Southern Africa. His military strategy centered around mobility, surprise attacks, and guerrilla tactics. Rather than engaging in direct conflict, Hintsa preferred to harass and raid his enemies from a distance. His army comprised warriors from various tribes and clans who followed his leadership and command. He also garnered support from allies and tributaries from other African kingdoms in times of war.

During Hintsa's reign, the Xhosa Kingdom found itself in conflict with the Cape Colony, which was under British rule. Additionally, the Xhosa nation faced internal tensions due to civil wars among chiefs and the influx of refugee tribes from the Mfecane. These factors led to a series of wars, known as the Frontier Wars or the Xhosa Wars, spanning over a century. 

The pivotal event that sparked the Sixth Frontier War, also known as the Hintsa War, was the murder of a high-ranking Xhosa chief by a Cape government commando party. This act of aggression provoked the Xhosa people, resulting in an army of 10,000 men, led by Rharhabe chief Maqoma, launching an assault on the Cape Colony. The British eventually intervened, halting their advance after extensive pillaging, burning, and loss of life.

These conflicts were characterized by brutal fighting, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. Sir Harry Smith and Sir Benjamin d'Urban, leading British troops, sought Help from Hintsa to attack the Rharhabe chiefs. Initially willing to support the British with 1,000 men, it became clear that Hintsa would not betray his fellow Xhosa leaders. This led to d'Urban using it as an excuse to declare war on Hintsa.

British governor Sir Benjamin D'Urban confronted King Hintsa with a substantial army, holding him responsible for attacks on the Cape Colony due to his paramount authority over the Xhosa nation and its chiefdoms. Rather than escalating the conflict, Hintsa chose to engage in peace talks with the British. In May 1835, Hintsa, accompanied by British soldiers led by Governor Harry Smith, participated in peace negotiations. However, the British demands proved to be unreasonable and intended to humiliate and weaken Hintsa.

Sensing this, Hintsa refused to yield and decided to terminate the negotiations. As he left, British soldiers captured him and held him as a hostage. They forced him to march alongside the British army, subjecting him to torture and abuse. During this time, his kingdom was ravaged by British troops, resulting in the destruction of villages, loss of lives, and seizures of cattle. Despite numerous escape attempts, Hintsa was recaptured and assaulted. On May 12, 1835, Hintsa managed to break free and fled toward a nearby river.

Pursued by Smith and his men, he was fatally shot in the back. In a final act of barbarity, Smith ordered Hintsa's ears to be severed as evidence of his death. His head was also detached and taken as a gruesome trophy. Hintsa's body was left unburied, while his head was later displayed in a museum in Britain.

Hintsa's death stands as a tragic and disgraceful event in the history of the Xhosa people and the British Empire. It symbolized the end of Xhosa resistance and independence, giving way to a period of colonial domination and oppression. Nevertheless, Hintsa's legacy endures in the memories and culture of the Xhosa people, who consider him a heroic martyr.

He remains a potent symbol of African dignity, sovereignty, and a source of inspiration in the struggle against colonialism and apartheid. After a prolonged campaign by the Xhosa people and the South African government, Hintsa's head was finally returned to South Africa in 1996. It was laid to rest with full honors in his ancestral land, allowing his spirit to find peace at last.

Chapter 5: Socio-Political Organization and Leadership within the Xhosa tribes.


Traditional Governance Structures
Traditional governance structures have played a significant role in shaping the history and identity of the Xhosa people of South Africa. These structures have evolved over centuries and continue to hold great importance to this day.

Traditional governance structures among the Xhosa people are characterized by a strong emphasis on kinship and communal decision-making. The chief or king, often referred to as the Inkosi, plays a pivotal role in maintaining social order and resolving disputes within the community. The Inkosi is assisted by a council of elders, who offer guidance and wisdom based on their wealth of experience and knowledge.

Furthermore, the Xhosa people have a deep connection to their ancestral spirits, which are believed to influence their daily lives and provide guidance to their leaders. Traditional ceremonies and rituals, such as the ukubuyisa or ancestral homecoming, reinforce this spiritual connection and strengthen the bond between the living and the deceased.
While modern governance structures have been introduced in South Africa, the traditional governance systems of the Xhosa people continue to hold significant cultural and symbolic value. They serve as a reminder of the rich history and heritage of the Xhosa people and provide a sense of identity and belonging to Xhosa individuals.
5.1. Roles and responsibilities of clan leaders.
The Xhosa nation encompasses a diversity of tribes and clans that share a  connection through their ancestry and culture. At the heart of this nation are the leaders, who have long served as the esteemed leaders of their respective tribes and clans. These remarkable individuals have historically played pivotal roles in shaping the political, social, and religious landscape of the Xhosa people. 

Throughout history, the tribe and clan leaders have been entrusted with important responsibilities. They have stood as stalwart representatives, engaging in negotiations and interactions with other tribes, clans, and colonial authorities. When sincere, these leaders have diligently worked to maintain the unity, harmony, and well-being of their people by skillfully resolving disputes, enforcing laws, and ensuring protection for all. 

The tribe and clan leaders have also held sacred roles in their culture's traditions. They have dutifully presided over the traditional courts, ceremonies, and rituals that formed the fabric of Xhosa society. From the significant rites of initiation, marriage, and burial, these leaders have been instrumental in upholding and perpetuating the cultural practices that define the Xhosa people. In doing so, they have fostered a deep respect for ancestral heritage, unwavering loyalty to the tribe, and a steadfast devotion to the Xhosa language and dress.

In accordance with the patrilineal system of succession, the tribe and clan leaders have inherited their esteemed positions from their fathers or other male relatives, ensuring a sense of continuity and stability within their leadership. 

In democratic South Africa the relevance of the traditional leaders has growingly been questioned. The relevance of amakhosi or inkosi has come under scrutiny by many, especially due to the substantial taxpayer funds they receive, with little impact on alleviating poverty even in the rural areas they represent. This also brings up an important question for taxpayers across the nation who are not associated with the Eastern Cape or the Xhosa people, why should they have to bear the weight of something that does not concern them? 

Traditional leaders primarily advocate for their own communities and tribes, not comprehensively representing the entire country's population, so why should the burden be shouldered by individuals who do not receive any benefits from the traditional leaders?

5.2. Clan Hierarchy and Power Dynamics.
The principle of seniority forms the basis of the Xhosa tribe hierarchy and power dynamics. 

The tribe that can trace its lineage back to the oldest ancestor or the first-born son of the common ancestor holds authority over the clans, along with the right to leadership and prestige. This tribe also takes on the responsibility of protecting and guiding the clans. In Xhosa culture, the tribe that holds this responsibility is known as the "Great House". 

They are not only guardians of tradition and values but also arbiters in settling disputes and making important decisions for the entire tribe. Their role as the "Great House" encompasses not only leadership but also upholding the spiritual and cultural practices that define the tribe's people, ensuring continuity and preservation of their heritage for future generations. This esteemed position comes with immense respect, but also a weighty burden, as the tribe looks to them for guidance and unity in times of both celebration and challenge. 

The Xhosa clan hierarchy and power dynamics are not only determined by the principle of seniority but are also influenced by historical events and political alliances. Wars and conflicts over land, cattle, and leadership have led to divisions and rivalries between some tribes. Additionally, alliances formed with other tribes, clans, or colonial powers have affected their status and influence in Xhosa society.

5.3. Evolution of leadership in modern Xhosa society.
Tribe and clan leaders, also known as amakhosi or inkosi, have wielded significant influence in the realms of politics, society, and religion among the Xhosa people. They have played pivotal roles in fostering relationships with other groups and colonial authorities, leaving a lasting impact on the Xhosa society as a whole. 

However, the Xhosa society has also experienced the tumultuous influence of colonialism and apartheid. These systems disrupted and altered the traditional structures and customs of the Xhosa people, introducing new forms of governance and administration.

In the face of challenges such as land dispossession, taxation, migration, education, and resistance, Xhosa leaders had to adapt and respond accordingly. Some leaders chose to collaborate with colonial and apartheid regimes, while others opposed and resisted them. 

Furthermore, following the end of apartheid in 1994, the Xhosa society embarked on a democratic transition that presented both opportunities and challenges for the Xhosa people and their leaders. While the Xhosa people gained increased political rights, representation, and access to education, health, and development, they also had to confront pressing issues such as poverty, unemployment, inequality, corruption, and violence.

Xhosa leaders found themselves in the delicate position of balancing the expectations and demands of their people with the requirements and regulations of the democratic state. In addition to these historical factors, the Xhosa society has also been influenced by the forces of globalisation and modernization. These processes have exposed the Xhosa people and their leaders to new ideas, values, and influences, resulting in a greater diversity and heterogeneity within the Xhosa society. 

As the Xhosa people adopt different lifestyles, identities, and aspirations, Xhosa leaders are challenged with managing this complexity and diversity, while also navigating the intricacies of competition and cooperation with other groups and actors.

5.4. Impact of the South African Constitution on Xhosa customs and laws. 
The South African Constitution and laws have had a profound impact on the traditional legal systems of the Xhosa people. This has been both positive and negative.

Prior to the arrival of colonial rule, the Xhosa had well-established customary laws and systems of justice that governed their society. However, with the establishment of a centralised legal system under British rule and the subsequent codification of laws, the traditional legal systems of the Xhosa underwent significant changes. 

One of the major impacts of the South African Constitution on Xhosa legal systems is the recognition of customary law. The Constitution acknowledges customary law as a valid source of legislation and highlights the importance of preserving cultural and traditional practices. This recognition has allowed certain aspects of Xhosa customary law to be incorporated into the broader legal framework of South Africa. These rights have had a significant impact on the traditional legal systems of the Xhosa, as they have prompted a reevaluation of certain practices and norms within their traditional customs. 

Additionally, the South African legal system has established mechanisms for resolving disputes in accordance with customary law.These mechanisms, including the establishment of traditional courts, aim to maintain the integrity of Xhosa legal traditions while operating within the broader constitutional framework. 

However, it should be noted that the impact of the South African Constitution and laws on Xhosa legal systems has not been without challenges. There have been debates and tensions regarding the balance between preserving cultural traditions and upholding constitutional rights, particularly in cases where traditional practices may conflict with constitutional principles.

Regarding criminal law, conflicts have arisen surrounding issues like corporal punishment and customary penalties, which may contradict the constitutional prohibition of cruel and inhuman punishment. The challenge lies in striking a balance between respecting cultural traditions and safeguarding individual rights within the broader legal framework. 

In terms of property law, conflicts arise when traditional practices, such as communal land ownership, clash with individual property rights recognized by the constitution. This has led to complex legal battles and the need for innovative solutions that bridge the gap between cultural preservation and constitutional protections. 

The conflict between traditional Xhosa practices and modern South African law is an ongoing and intricate issue. This creates tension between the Xhosa community's desire to preserve their cultural heritage and the government's obligation to protect individuals from Harm. 

The practice of ukuthwala, in which young women are kidnapped for marriage, is another traditional practice that is in conflict with the law and widely frowned upon today. It involves forcibly taking a girl or woman against her will, often resulting in forced marriages and severe emotional and physical abuse. Activists and organisations have made efforts to raise awareness and advocate for the eradication of this practice. 

While male circumcision for the Xhosa is still legal, there has been increasing condemnation of this practice due to the numerous initiates who have died or faced health complications, some with lasting physical impairments. In 2021, Dispatch Live reported that the number of deaths of Xhosa initiates had reached 858 in the previous 15 years. This alarming figure has continued to rise, exceeding 900 by the end of 2023. This trend emphasizes the urgent need for increased regulation and oversight of the traditional initiation process.

There are signs that the Xhosa customary law conflict is on its way to being resolved. However, instead of customary law taking a leading role whenever it is appropriate, it is more likely that its elements will be incorporated into national law, albeit loosely. As a result, traditional structures will slowly diminish over time. 

An aspect of customary law that I find problematic is how immovable property is collectively managed. 

This approach has led to a significant decrease in investment in rural South Africa as property investment lacks security of tenure. The communal property system in rural South Africa is detrimental to investment and disrespectful to rural property owners. This system hampers economic development in rural areas by discouraging private investment and stifling entrepreneurship. It deprives property owners of the autonomy and control over their land, hindering them from fully utilising it for productive purposes. 

Furthermore, the lack of clear land ownership rights hinders the ability to access credit and loans, which hampers investment and limits economic growth. In law, individuals who rely on others to handle their affairs often face obstacles in making decisions for themselves, primarily due to factors such as age, mental incapacity, or other forms of incapability. The communal property system in rural areas implies that adults who have been managing their affairs for centuries lack the capacity to manage their own assets.

This system is an insult to rural property owners who should have the right to make decisions about their land and benefit from its use. It perpetuates inequality and prevents the accumulation of wealth and assets among rural communities. Overall, the communal property system in rural South Africa is detrimental to investment and undermines the rights and potential of rural property owners. 

This is one of the aspects that few would miss in modern day South Africa as it has been a huge impediment.
Chapter 6: Cultural Traditions and Practices.
“If you come to me but will not leave your family, you cannot be my follower. You must love me more than your father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters—even more than your own life!”
 Luke 14:26




Language, beliefs and heritage.

The Xhosa people not only share commonalities with other Nguni people and the broader Bantu community, but also possess distinctive characteristics that distinguish them. These distinctions not only differentiate them from other Nguni nations but also within the various tribes that comprise the Xhosa nation.

The Xhosa nation's rich cultural heritage is evident in their traditional clothing, music, and dance, which are all integral parts of their identity. This strong sense of cultural pride and heritage has played a significant role in shaping the Xhosa community. Their traditional clothing, music, and dance reflect their deep connection to their history and values, providing a cohesive thread that binds the community together across generations. This preservation and celebration of their cultural heritage continues to be a source of strength and resilience for the Xhosa people.

The food they have adapted to consider as a staple was largely shaped by the offerings available within the different areas, hence even though you will see many commonalities between dishes and traditions there are subtle differences from place to place.

The variability in Xhosa traditions can be attributed to the adaptable oral traditions that have been a fundamental source of knowledge for African peoples over the centuries. Initially, I perceived the absence of written records as a vulnerability, potentially paving the way for misinterpretation and exploitation. However, I now understand that this lack of documentation has enabled Xhosa traditions to evolve and remain relevant in response to societal and environmental changes.

The existence of ancient written records has presented a challenge for those who seek to adhere strictly to their literal meanings in a changing world. Scholars have had to provide interpretations to adapt these writings to current times, which I suspect is the reason there is the Old Testament and the New Testament, as well as various Christian church denominations aiming to serve their specific followers through scripture interpretation.

6.1. Xhosa language and communication.
IsiXhosa, also known as the Xhosa language, holds a significant place as one of the official languages of South Africa and Zimbabwe. It belongs to the Nguni group of Bantu languages, which includes Zulu, Swati, and Ndebele. Across the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Gauteng, and Free State provinces of South Africa, as well as in parts of Zimbabwe and Lesotho, the Xhosa language is spoken by approximately 17 million individuals.

The Xhosa language took root during the movement of the Nguni people from Central and East Africa to Southern Africa between the 10th and 15th centuries. As the Nguni people interacted with the Khoikhoi and the San, the indigenous inhabitants of the region, they incorporated some of their words and click sounds. Over time, different subgroups emerged, such as the Xhosa, Zulu, Swati, and Ndebele, each bringing forth its own dialects and cultures.

Characterized by its intricate phonology, morphology, and syntax, the Xhosa language boasts 26 letters from the Latin alphabet, even though some are pronounced differently from English. With 18 consonants and 10 vowels, which can be either short or long, Xhosa is classified as a tonal language. This means that the pitch of one's voice can change the meaning of a word. The Xhosa language encompasses two fundamental tones: high and low.

A distinguishing feature of the Xhosa language lies in the use of click sounds, created by suction inside the mouth. Dental, alveolar, and lateral clicks form the three types of clicks in Xhosa. The dental click occurs when the tongue's tip is placed behind the upper front teeth and released with a sucking sound. The alveolar click happens when the tongue's tip rests on the alveolar ridge, just behind the upper front teeth, and is released with a popping sound. Lastly, the lateral click takes place when the sides of the tongue rest on the molars and are released with a smacking sound. These clicks can be modified by adding other consonants or vowels before or after them.

Xhosa's agglutinative morphology, wherein words are formed by adding prefixes and suffixes to roots, is another notable attribute. This language embodies 15 noun classes, marked by prefixes indicating the number, gender, and category of the noun. For instance, the prefix "um-" signifies a singular noun of class 1, typically relating to humans or animals, while the prefix "aba-" represents a plural noun of class 2, belonging to the same category as class 1. Furthermore, Xhosa possesses a complex verb system encompassing a range of aspects, moods, tenses, and voices. By adding various prefixes and suffixes to the verb "ukubona" (to see), different meanings can be expressed, such as "ndiyakubona" (I see you), "andiyikubona" (I do not see you), "ndiyakubonisa" (I show you), "ndiyakubonwa" (I am seen by you), and so on.

The Xhosa language draws influence from its history, culture, and society. Due to trade, colonization, migration, and globalization, it has borrowed words from various languages, including English, Afrikaans, Dutch, Portuguese, Arabic, and Hindi.

Xhosa also reflects the values, beliefs, and traditions of the Xhosa people, who possess a strong sense of identity and belonging. The language is used to convey respect, dignity, and unity among the Xhosa community, as well as to communicate with their ancestors and their God. Moreover, Xhosa plays a vital role in creating and preserving the oral literature of the Xhosa people, such as proverbs, idioms, praise names, poems, songs, stories, and legends.

In contemporary South African society, the Xhosa language continues to hold relevance and exert influence, contributing to the nation's diversity, unity, and development. Recognized as one of the 11 official languages in the South African Constitution, Xhosa is employed across various domains, including education, media, politics, business, and arts. It is taught as a subject in many schools and is supported by numerous organizations and institutions.

The Xhosa language instills pride and strength within the Xhosa people and serves as a source of inspiration and learning for others.

As a living and dynamic language, Xhosa adapts and evolves with the changing times without compromising its core features and functions. It celebrates and upholds diversity while nurturing unity.

6.2. Traditional beliefs and spirituality.
"Qamata" is a Xhosa deity or supreme being, while "Thixo" refers to God in line with Christian beliefs, likely introduced by missionaries. 

"Qamata" is more closely associated with the traditional Xhosa belief system and "Thixo" being a widely used term for God in the Xhosa Language. Qamata is seen as an omnipresent force, both benevolent and malevolent, who governs the world and influences the destiny of individuals. An integral aspect of Xhosa spirituality is the veneration of ancestors.

Ancestors are believed to be intermediaries between the living and Qamata, wielding  significant influence on human affairs. The Xhosa people believe that ancestors possess the power to bless or curse their descendants, depending on their behaviour and adherence to traditional values. Ancestors are consulted and honoured through rituals, prayers, and offerings, as they are seen as protectors and providers of guidance. 

However, the influence of Christianity has had a profound impact on Xhosa spirituality. With the arrival of European settlers and missionaries, Christianity was introduced to the Xhosa community. Many Xhosa people have embraced Christianity and integrated it into their spiritual practices.

Today, a significant portion of Xhosa people identify themselves as Christians while still attempting to maintain a connection to their ancestral beliefs. The influence of Christianity on Xhosa spirituality has not been without tensions. Traditionalists, like myself, believe that Christianity has weakened their ancestral beliefs and undermines the true essence of their spirituality.

Despite the effort to reconcile the Xhosa belief system with Christianity, the reality is that the two are not compatible. Christianity and traditional Xhosa belief systems often clash due to their different perspectives on authority and spiritual connection. Christianity centres around the authority figure of Jesus to connect to God, while Xhosa tradition emphasises connecting with Qamata through family and ancestors. 

A conflict with one's family, whether they are alive or deceased, often leads to a diminished or even broken bond with Qamata in the Xhosa community. However, in Christianity, it is quite the opposite. In fact, relinquishing one's family is seen as a prerequisite to demonstrate unwavering devotion to Jesus.
Yes, for this reason, the two belief systems are incompatible, leading most individuals to ultimately embrace Christianity while Qamata fades into memory.  These contrasting views create tension between the two belief systems, leading to conflicts within the Xhosa community.

Christian missionaries have sought to convert Xhosa people to their faith, which has disrupted the traditional practices and deep-rooted beliefs of the Xhosa culture. The clash between Christianity and traditional Xhosa belief systems raises questions of cultural preservation and the right to one's own spiritual practices. This ongoing conflict symbolises the broader struggle between Western ideologies and indigenous cultures, as Christianity represents the dominant, foreign religion, while Xhosa tradition reflects the cultural heritage of the people. The rise of fake prophets and their churches in the Eastern Cape has taken advantage of people's poverty and desperation, exploiting their vulnerability for personal gain.

These so-called prophets often manipulate followers into giving large sums of money or other valuable assets in exchange for false promises of wealth or healing. As a result, many individuals and families are left in even greater financial distress after being deceived by these fraudulent practices. Xhosa spirituality is a complex tapestry that weaves together belief in Qamata, ancestral veneration, while trying to navigate the influence of religion.

The Xhosa people also have a deep connection to nature and the elements. They believe in the presence of ancestral spirits in natural phenomena such as rivers, mountains, and trees. These natural elements are considered sacred and are often sites of rituals and ceremonies. Traditional healers play a crucial role in Xhosa society. They possess specialised knowledge and skills to communicate with the spirits, diagnose illnesses, and provide remedies. The Xhosa people have immense faith in the healing powers of these traditional healers, who are respected and revered for their wisdom and abilities.

6.3. Rites of passage and initiation ceremonies.
The Xhosa people have a rich cultural heritage that is deeply rooted in various rites of passage. These rituals have been practised for centuries and continue to hold great significance in Xhosa society, both historically and in the present. One of the most renowned and significant rites of passage among the Xhosa is the initiation ceremony known as "ulwaluko."

This ritual marks the transition of young boys into manhood and is considered a crucial milestone in a Xhosa man's life. During ulwaluko, boys, as in amakhwenkwe, are taken to isolated initiation schools, where they undergo circumcision and are taught about their cultural heritage, responsibilities, and obligations as men in Xhosa society. Another important rite of passage is the initiation of girls, known as "intonjane." Intonjane is focused on teaching girls about womanhood, traditional values, and skills essential for their roles as wives and mothers.
 
Weddings also hold significant importance in Xhosa culture, symbolising the transition from being single to being married. Intonjane is a rite of passage for girls practised by some of the peoples of South Africa including the Xhosa nation. In Xhosa, “intombi” refers to a girl and “njane” is used to denote something small, thus a direct translation of Intonjane would be young girl.The practice is done when a girl goes through her first menstruation. It is a significant cultural practice that marks the transition from a young girl, to a young woman that can potentially marry. During the Intonjane ceremony, the girl is secluded and taught various skills, traditions, and responsibilities that are expected of a young woman in Xhosa culture. The purpose is to prepare her for adulthood and ensure that she is equipped with the necessary knowledge to navigate through life.

Intonjane held great value among the Xhosa people, particularly in the past, as it played a crucial role in promoting family cohesion and creating a nurturing environment for raising children. Following Intonjane, young women were prepared for marriage, significantly reducing the likelihood of them having children outside of wedlock. Not only did Intonjane prepare young women for marriage, but it also instilled values such as responsibility, respect, and loyalty, which were essential in maintaining healthy relationships within the Xhosa community. 

Ulwaluko and intonjane mark the transitions into adulthood for boys and girls, respectively, while traditional Xhosa weddings celebrate the union of two individuals. These important ceremonies help maintain and honour the cultural heritage of the Xhosa people, ensuring that their customs and traditions remain vibrant and cherished in the modern world.

6.4. Xhosa Arts and Crafts.
Xhosa arts and crafts have long played a significant role in the cultural identity of the Xhosa people. These artistic expressions encompass a wide range of disciplines, including bead work, pottery, woodcarving, and weaving. Xhosa artisans use vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and symbolism to create unique and meaningful pieces. These are often inspired by nature, spirituality, and traditional Xhosa beliefs, infusing their creations with rich cultural significance and historical resonance.

The art of bead work in Xhosa culture is particularly noteworthy, with beads being used to represent important aspects of life such as status, age, and marital status. Each bead colour and pattern carries its own significance, making every piece of bead work a visual narrative of the individual's story. The intricate patterns and meticulous craftsmanship of Xhosa beadwork reflect the deep respect for tradition and community that lies at the heart of Xhosa culture.

Pottery and weaving are also important forms of artistic expression in Xhosa culture, with pottery vessels and woven baskets showcasing the skilled craftsmanship of the Xhosa people. Pottery, often adorned with intricate patterns and symbols, serves as both functional items for daily use and artwork that preserves the cultural heritage of the Xhosa community.

Weaving, on the other hand, involves the interlacing of natural members to create beautiful baskets used for storage, ceremonial purposes, or even as decorative pieces. In literature, Xhosa poets have played a vital role in preserving and promoting the Xhosa language and oral tradition.

Notable Xhosa poets include S.E.K. Mqhayi and Nontsizi Mgqwetho, whose works have influenced generations of poets and writers, both locally and internationally. Xhosa actors have also made their mark in the film and theatre industry. Talents like John Kani, Nomsa Nene, and Nomhle Nkonyeni have captivated audiences with their exceptional performances, bringing Xhosa stories to the forefront and breaking barriers in the entertainment world. Finally, Xhosa composers have contributed to the development of classical music in South Africa. Composer of the South African national anthem, "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika," also contributed to the rich musical heritage of the Xhosa people.

His timeless composition remains a powerful symbol of unity and liberation, resonating with people across the globe. Another essential aspect of Xhosa culture is the celebration of important milestones and cultural events. These celebrations not only reinforce the cultural heritage of the Xhosa people but also serve as important opportunities for communal bonding and the passing down of traditions from one generation to the next.


6.5. Xhosa Cuisine and Traditional Food.

“The Kaffirs are an agricultural as well as a pastoral people. They cultivate the ground to a large extent, and draw the greater portion of their food from it. A species of millet, called by the colonists Kaffir corn, was the grain exclusively cultivated by them prior to the advent of Europeans. 
Of this they raise large quantities, which they use either boiled, or bruised into a paste from which bread is made. 
They were acquainted with the art of fermenting it and making a kind of beer, which they were fond of drinking, and which soon caused intoxication. Of this grain they were careful always to keep a good stock on hand. 
They preserved it from the attacks of the weevil by storing it in air-tight holes excavated beneath the cattle kraals. They had also pumpkins, a species of gourd, a cane containing saccharine matter in large quantities, and a sort of ground nut. The other productions of their gardens, as we see them at present, have been introduced since they became acquainted with the white man. 
Of those mentioned their food consisted, with the addition of curdled milk and occasionally flesh.  They have two meals a day, a slight breakfast in the morning, and a substantial repast at sunset. Boys in early youth are permitted to cat any kind of meat, even that of wild cats and other carnivora, but when they reach the age of maturity the flesh of all unclean animals is rejected by them. 
They use no kinds of fish as an article of clict, and call them all snakes, without distinction.”

Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk-Lore, by George McCall Theal





The rich and diverse Xhosa culture extends beyond their fascinating history and traditions, encompassing a vibrant culinary heritage that reflects their deep-rooted connection to the land and their ancestors. The Xhosa people, who are an integral part of South Africa's cultural tapestry, have developed a unique cuisine that combines influences from their Bantu origins, interactions with the Khoisan people, and the distinct regional variations that emerged after their split from the Zulu.

Xhosa cuisine is characterised by an emphasis on fresh, locally sourced ingredients that are abundant in the Eastern Cape region, where the majority of Xhosa people reside. The fertile lands provide a bountiful array of fruits, vegetables, grains, and livestock, which form the foundation of their traditional dishes.

One of the staples of Xhosa cuisine is umngqusho, a hearty and nutritious dish made from dried maize kernels and sugar beans. This dish holds significant cultural symbolism as it was once considered a delicacy reserved for special occasions and festivals.At its most basic the dish is only made of dried maize kernels and sugar beans with seasoning and fat for tase. Variations of this dish include addition of vegetable and meat for a hearty stew . Today, umngqusho remains a beloved comfort food that brings families and communities together.

Another popular dish is umxhaxha, a sour porridge made from fermented sorghum or maize. This tangy and refreshing dish is often enjoyed as a breakfast staple, providing sustenance and energy for the day ahead. I have no recollection of eating umxhaxha but I have had what I think to be its Tswana equivalent “ting”. 

The Xhosa culture places great importance on meat, especially lamb, beef, and chicken, which are central to their culinary customs. This was evident when Mila's Pedi father visited with a mutual friend of house, KG a couple of years ago.

Upon their arrival, we were in the midst of a traditional ceremony, and as they joined us, we had just finished slaughtering and were having our first braai of the day, which they joined in. Two hours later, another serving came from the kraal, and we continued to enjoy more meat before the main meal, which also prominently featured meat. By the following day, they opted for pap and vegetables, no longer desiring any meat.

Goat meat is also highly valued, frequently utilised for rituals and cultural ceremonies. I vividly recall my initiation into manhood, where I engaged in a symbolic wrestling match with a large piece of goat meat during the celebratory feast.

"Ukoja," the Xhosa term for braai, represents a cherished method of meat preparation that holds a special place in my heart, evoking memories with my father. Our trips to town were always eagerly anticipated, largely because I knew we’d braai after finishing our activities. Given that most of our meals at home were prepared indoors, a braai became a special occasion. Braaing for the family in our rural village was often interpreted as an invitation for the community as they, in the spirit of being neighbourly, assumed that maybe we were having a traditional ceremony or sacrifice and as community members it was their duty to come and help.

Pork is also cherished in our culture, prized for its rich flavour and satisfying qualities, serving as a welcome indulgence in the rural villages where meat was a rare treat. The communal ethos of our villages, where celebrations involved the entire community, often provided nourishing meals, a significant source of sustenance in challenging circumstances. The pig's head is a beloved delicacy in my home, enjoyed by every member of the family, including the four legged ones. While we savor the succulent meat, Skhokho and Peanut delight in gnawing on the tantalizing bones for days on end.

Other notable Xhosa dishes include;
Umcuku
Isophu
Iphukutsha
Umqa
Qumatana
Umkhupha
Ulusu

In addition to these traditional dishes, Xhosa cuisine also encompasses a wide range of wild foods that are foraged from the surrounding landscape. These include wild spinach and other fruit and vegetable, which add unique flavours and textures to their meals. The Xhosa people's close connection to nature is evident in their culinary practices, as they embrace sustainable and environmentally friendly food sources.

For Xhosa people and South Africans, exploring the intricacies of Xhosa cuisine is not only a culinary journey but also a way to connect with their ancestral roots. By savouring the flavours and aromas of traditional Xhosa dishes, one can gain a deeper understanding of the history, culture, and resilience of the Xhosa people.
Chapter 7: Contact, conflict and cooperation with Colonial forces.


7.1. Early contact with European explorers.
The early encounters between the Xhosa people and European explorers mark a crucial turning point in the history of the Xhosa nation. These encounters, which took place during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, would forever shape the destiny of the Xhosa people as they navigated the challenges and opportunities brought by the arrival of Europeans to their shores.

It was during this period of migration and integration that European explorers, driven by a desire for new trade routes and resources, began to venture into the southern regions of Africa. The arrival of these explorers, such as Bartholomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama, brought about a series of significant changes for the Xhosa people.
Initially, the encounters between the Xhosa and the Europeans were characterised by curiosity and cautious exploration. 

Both sides were intrigued by the differences in culture, language, and technology. For the Xhosa people, the arrival of these foreigners opened up new trade possibilities and introduced them to novel goods and technologies.

However, as European colonisation and settlement intensified in the region, tensions began to arise. The Xhosa people, who had a long history of self-governance and independence, found themselves faced with the encroachment of European powers on their lands. This led to a series of conflicts, known as the Xhosa Wars, as the Xhosa people fiercely resisted European domination.



7.2. Historical Xhosa wars and resistance movements.
The Xhosa Wars, often referred to as the Frontier Wars, were a series of conflicts between the Xhosa groups and the British colonial forces. These wars spanned several decades, from the early 18th century to the mid-19th century, and were characterised by a complex web of political, economic, and cultural factors. Here is an overview of the wars, their causes and consequences.

The First War (1779-1781) began when Boer frontiersmen captured Xhosa cattle. The war ended in a stalemate, with no clear winner. The impact on the Xhosa people
was minimal, as they kept their lands and livestock. The consequence was the establishment of the Great Fish River as the eastern boundary of the Cape Colony.

The Second War (1789-1793) was fought over a larger territory between resisting and collaborating Xhosa clans. The war ended in a Boer victory, as they pushed the Xhosa eastward and occupied the Zuurveld. The impact on the Xhosa people was significant, as they lost land and cattle and became divided. The consequence was the consolidation of Boer presence in the frontier region.

The Third War (1799-1803) saw the Khoikhoi joining the Xhosa in attacking white farmlands encroaching on Xhosa territory. The war ended in a British victory, as they intervened and drove the Xhosa and Khoikhoi from the Zuurveld. The impact on the Xhosa people was severe, as they lost land, cattle, and allies. The consequence was the British taking over the Cape Colony from the Dutch.

The Fourth War (1811-1812) was the first under British rule, caused by British expansion and Xhosa resistance. The war ended in a British victory, as they defeated Xhosa chief Ndlambe and his allies. The impact on the Xhosa people was devastating, with the loss of land, cattle, and leaders. The consequence was the British annexing the Zuurveld and renaming it Albany.

The Fifth War (1818-1819), also known as the War of Nxele, started over stolen cattle and a failed Xhosa prophet's attack on the British. The war ended in a British victory, as they captured and executed the prophet Makana and his followers. The impact on the Xhosa people was tragic, losing faith, morale, and dignity. The consequence was the British declaring the territory between the Great Fish and Keiskamma rivers as neutral, later ceded.

The Sixth War (1834-1836), also known as the War of Hintsa, began with Xhosa cattle raiding and British retaliation, leading to the death of Paramount Chief Hintsa. The war ended in a British victory, as they crushed the Xhosa army and occupied their lands. The impact on the Xhosa people was catastrophic, with the loss of land, cattle, and sovereignty. The consequence was the British annexing the territory between the Keiskamma and Kei rivers and naming it the Province of Queen Adelaide.

The Seventh War (1846-1847), also known as the War of the Axe or the Amatola War, was the bloodiest war, triggered by a Xhosa man's arrest for stealing an axe and subsequent uprising. The war ended in a British victory, as they defeated Xhosa chief Sandile and his allies. The impact on the Xhosa people was enormous, losing land, cattle, and warriors. The consequence was the British annexing the old neutral territory as the Crown Colony of British Kaffraria.

The Eighth War (1850-1853), also known as the War of Mlanjeni, was instigated by a Xhosa prophet calling for war and a multi-ethnic alliance against the British. The war ended in a British victory, as they suppressed the rebellion and captured the prophet Mlanjeni and his followers. The impact on the Xhosa people was immense, losing hope, unity, and resistance.The consequence was the British abolishing the Province of Queen Adelaide and incorporating it into the Cape Colony.

The Ninth War (1877-1879), also known as the War of Ngcayechibi, was the final war, ignited by a Xhosa chief's rebellion and famine driving the Xhosa to desperation. The war ended in a British victory, as they quelled the revolt and disarmed the Xhosa. The impact on the Xhosa people was disastrous, losing land, cattle, and independence. The consequence was the British abolishing the Crown Colony of British Kaffraria and incorporating it into the Cape Colony.

7.3. Historical instances of cooperation between the Xhosa, British and the Boers.
Despite the conflicts among the Xhosa, British, and Boers, instances of collaboration between them were not uncommon. Their need to work together for economic or security reasons often led to unexpected alliances and partnerships in the region. These arrangements were driven by pragmatism rather than genuine trust, resulting in complex and sometimes tenuous relationships among the groups involved. 

The constant competition for control over land and resources influenced the nature of these alliances, leading to a delicate balance of power where opportunism and self-interest played crucial roles. This dynamic environment gave rise to both surprising alliances and sudden betrayals, shaping the trajectory of the region.

Notable instances of cooperation include the Xhosa forming alliances with the British against the Boers, only to later switch sides to serve their own interests. The pursuit of power and survival in a ruthless landscape drove these fluid alliances, showcasing the ever-shifting dynamics of power and resources in the region.

Throughout history, there are numerous instances of collaboration between the Xhosa and the British and the Boers. In the early 1700s, certain Xhosa clans worked as cattle herders on settler farms, forming various alliances. In the 1790s, influential Xhosa chiefs like Ngqika and Ndlambe allied with the British against the Boers.This pattern of collaboration continued through the 19th century, with Xhosa chiefs embracing the arrival of missionaries, signing treaties with the British, and engaging in peace conferences, all in the pursuit of stability and the protection of their people's interests.

Additionally, there was a consistent pattern of shifting allegiances among the indigenous tribes as they navigated the challenges of colonial conquest. For example, the Zulu initially resisted both the British and the Boers but later formed a fragile partnership with the British before turning against them in the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879.

This demonstrates the complex and strategic relationships that indigenous tribes forged with colonial powers for survival and protection. The shifting allegiances reflect the multifaceted nature of indigenous responses to colonialism and the intricate political dynamics of the time.



7.4. Impact of Colonialism on Xhosa society.
The arrival of European colonisers in South Africa had a far-reaching impact on the Xhosa people, fundamentally transforming their social, cultural, economic, and political structures. The Xhosa, who trace their historical origins from Central Africa as Bantu, had already encountered significant cultural exchanges with the Khoisan people before the arrival of Europeans. Colonialism brought about a new wave of changes that would shape the Xhosa society for generations to come.

One of the most significant impacts of colonialism was the disruption of traditional Xhosa governance systems. European powers sought to exert control over the indigenous population, often imposing their own governance structures and undermining the authority of Xhosa chiefs. This led to tensions within Xhosa society and the erosion of traditional power structures.

Colonialism also brought about the introduction of Christianity to the Xhosa people. Missionaries arrived with the aim of converting the Xhosa to Christianity, resulting in an attempt to fuse traditional beliefs with Christian practices. 

Economically, colonialism had a detrimental effect on the Xhosa people. European settlers seized large tracts of land, displacing many Xhosa communities and disrupting their traditional agricultural practices. This loss of land and resources led to economic hardships and the erosion of traditional Xhosa livelihoods.

The impact of colonialism also extended to language and education. European powers imposed their languages, such as English and Afrikaans, as the dominant languages of communication and education. As a result, Xhosa language and cultural practices faced marginalisation, posing a threat to the preservation of Xhosa identity and heritage. 

Colonialism had a profound and lasting impact on Xhosa society. The disruptions caused by European colonisation led to changes in governance, religion, economics, language, and education. Understanding the impact of colonialism on the Xhosa people is crucial to comprehend the complex layers of their history, as well as to appreciate the resilience and strength of the Xhosa culture in the face of adversity.


Chapter 8: Xhosa Identity and Culture in Modern South Africa.


8. Challenges and opportunities in a changing society.
The Xhosa people have faced numerous obstacles throughout their history, including the split from the Zulu, encounters with the Khoikhoi, colonisation, Nongqawuse’s prophecy, forced removals, and oppressive policies. These challenges have tested the resilience and strength of the Xhosa community, but they have also provided opportunities for growth and resistance.

The Xhosa people, like many other South Africans, have been profoundly affected by poverty since the African National Congress assumed power. The Eastern Cape Province, with the largest Xhosa population, has suffered setbacks in most areas. It is ironic that the Eastern Cape Province is one of the ANC's strongholds, frequently ranking among the top provinces in terms of voter support for the party. . Unemployment in the province stands at a significantly higher 42% compared to the rest of the country, making it the highest among all provinces, unless one considers the expanded definition of unemployment, which, while also high at 47%, is not the country's worst. 

This has worsened the poverty levels among the Xhosa people, making it even more difficult for them to break free from the cycle of poverty and improve their lives. 

The formal education system in the Eastern Cape Province has also failed, with low literacy rates and insufficient resources for schools. Consequently, many Xhosa children are not receiving a quality education, which hinders their chances of future success. In terms of key socio-economic indicators such as income levels, access to basic services, and healthcare provision, the Eastern Cape ranks among the lowest in the country. 

Alarmingly, the crime statistics for the Eastern Cape Province, particularly in 2023, reveal a significant increase in violent crimes such as murder and robbery. The province's current murder rate is nearly double the national average, making it one of the highest in the country. 

It is ironic that since 1994, the Eastern Cape has been the main provider of presidents for the country, including renowned leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki. While these figures have been praised worldwide for their exceptional leadership abilities by reaching the highest political office, it is perplexing that the living conditions in their own provinces have not seen significant improvement, and instead remain among the most dire in the nation.

One can't help but imagine how beneficial it would have been if they had set an example by achieving noteworthy results in their home provinces, rather than relying solely on their persuasive rhetoric to secure prestigious positions. These statistics raise serious concerns about the effectiveness of leadership in addressing the socio-economic challenges faced by the Eastern Cape Province. 

Despite having leaders with impressive credentials, it appears that their impact on improving living conditions in their home province has been limited, leaving residents to grapple with persistently high crime rates and poor socio-economic indicators. The disparity between political success and tangible improvements on the ground underscores the complexities of governance and the pressing need for comprehensive solutions.

Despite some superficial achievements, such as rural electrification, the African National Congress' previous successes in the Eastern Cape Province have been overshadowed by the negative impact of unreliable and costly electricity, especially for the impoverished majority. This has created a cycle of poverty and hindered economic growth, forcing many communities to rely on costly alternatives like paraffin and wood for cooking and heating purposes.

As a result, the burden falls disproportionately on those who can least afford it, further perpetuating the cycle of economic inequality. In general, the Xhosa people's struggle resonates with many South Africans as the country continues to regress. The continuous migration of young individuals from the province in pursuit of better opportunities is an enduring pattern, despite previous assurances of rural development that were supported by costly taxpayer-funded initiatives that ultimately yielded little results.

Today, the Xhosa people find themselves in a rapidly changing society. Globalisation, urbanisation, and modernization have brought new opportunities for economic advancement and cultural exchange. However, these changes also pose challenges to the preservation of Xhosa traditions and the cohesion of their communities.

8.1. Xhosa cultural revival and preservation efforts.
In the rich tapestry of South African history, the Xhosa people have emerged as a prominent and influential group. Their journey from the heart of Central Africa as Bantu migrants to their interactions with the Khoisan people and eventual split from the Zulu has shaped their unique identity. Today, efforts to revive and preserve Xhosa culture are being undertaken by passionate individuals and organisations.

The Xhosa people proudly trace their lineage back to their Bantu ancestors, who migrated from Central Africa over hundreds of years. This migration brought them into contact with the Khoisan people, resulting in a fusion of cultural practices and traditions. The blending of these two distinct groups created a vibrant and diverse community.

In recent years, there has been a renewed focus on reviving and preserving Xhosa culture. This research has helped to piece together the puzzle of Xhosa history, providing valuable insights into their origins and evolution.

I recently discovered a wealth of historical documents in the Van Warmelo Collection, which can be accessed for free on the University of Pretoria website. Over the course of 30 to 40 years, Dr Van Warmelo, the State Ethnologist in the Department of Bantu Affairs, dutifully and meticulously collected these documents. Upon his demise, these were donated to the university. This collection contains the original manuscripts that describe various aspects of the history, customs, and traditions of the indigenous people of what is now South Africa. South African Heritage Publishers have transcribed historical documents for easier access and offer a membership for less than R400 a year.

For Xhosa people, these preservation efforts have become a source of pride and empowerment. By embracing their cultural heritage, they are reclaiming their identity in a modern world. Language revitalization programs, traditional music and dance performances, and community celebrations have all become vehicles for preserving and promoting Xhosa culture.

The Xhosa literary revival is a movement that seeks to revitalize and enrich the Xhosa literature, both oral and written, by producing and publishing new works, as well as recovering and preserving old works. The Xhosa literary revival is led by contemporary Xhosa writers, such as Mphuthumi Ntabeni, who explore the deep history and culture of the Xhosa people in their novels, poems, and essays.

The Xhosa people's historical journey from Central Africa to South Africa, their interactions with the Khoisan people, and their split from the Zulu have shaped their unique identity. The efforts to revive and preserve Xhosa culture have gained momentum in recent years, with history lovers, Xhosa people, and South Africans all playing a crucial role. By unravelling the intricacies of Xhosa history and embracing their cultural heritage, the Xhosa people are forging a path towards a vibrant and empowered future.

8.2. Influence of contemporary communication, record keeping, and government systems on the revival and preservation efforts.
Many people, both in their personal lives and through work, have been working hard to preserve and bring back Xhosa cultural practices and traditions. In line with our oral tradition, unacknowledged expertise, and informal learning, the individuals who have been doing this are often only recognized by their immediate families and communities, such as parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and others who uphold traditional practices, primarily in the rural villages of the country.

The cooperation and coexistence between Africa and the West and East have expanded the reach of their contributions beyond their immediate circles. Thanks to social media, books, and other forms of communication and record keeping, people worldwide can now access the expertise of these unsung heroes, regardless of their internet connection or media access.

There is no denying that the West has played a major role in the gradual erosion of the Xhosa's adherence to tradition and culture. Some of the most significant factors include the imposition of Western laws, the undermining of traditional informal practices through formal schooling, and military conquest. 

It is truly ironic that the opposite holds true, and perhaps even more so, because now we have educational institutions that not only train and certify individuals, but also provide a platform for demonstrating their expertise and ongoing research on the subject. It's noteworthy that the majority of the sources I used for my research and writing were in English, which I was able to access because of the technology available to me as an African in South Africa. This technology, largely created by people from outside Africa, has granted me access to information from around the world.

As a result, preservation efforts have become more achievable than ever before. Government structures in the modern era have implemented funding mechanisms to support both organizations and individuals who are deeply dedicated to preserving the rich and vibrant Xhosa culture. Additionally, the South African Constitution recognizes and acknowledges the importance of the Xhosa people, a reflection of the lasting influence of Western heritage that can be traced back to the founding of America and even beyond, to the time of the Romans.

Professor Nokuzola Mndende, an esteemed professor in the Sociology and Anthropology department of Nelson Mandela University who completed her PhD completed in 2002. The use of modern-day technologies has facilitated dialogue among people with a common objective, even when approaching it in different ways. 

Daluxo Hobo has brought forward compelling insights about Xhosa traditional practices and culture, while also critically examining the professor's approach to promoting her views, especially in relation to the Bible. Jongisilo Pokwana ka Menziwa, Mndende’s nephew according to the post, has also authored an insightful piece titled “Mndende and her delusional anti-Mfenguism posture”. These discussions would not be accessible to me in my home office in Johannesburg if it were not for the modern technologies that can either be a blessing or a curse. I highlight this example because I am currently engrossed in the discourse and actively seeking diverse voices through various mediums to expand my understanding.

While composing this book, I am actively delving into the ultimate resolution of the conflict. Nonetheless, I am profoundly grateful for the invaluable resources at my disposal that enable me to examine the conflict's inception, reaching back to the year 2017 and even beyond, as far as the documented record allows. By utilizing these resources, I can trace the potential resolution of the conflict well into the future, up to the year 2024 and beyond. Although I have not yet reached the point in my research where these findings become apparent, the resources I possess present an exclusive opportunity to personally glean insights from the past, rather than relying solely on oral accounts passed down by my predecessors.

8.3. Xhosa influence in Politics, Arts and Literature.
In the realm of politics, the Xhosa people have been key players throughout South Africa's history. Their leaders, such as Hintsa and Sarhili, were influential figures who played crucial roles in resisting colonial rule and advocating for the rights of their people. 

The Xhosa Wars, fought against the British in the 19th century, are a testament to their unwavering determination and strategic prowess. These conflicts, rooted in the Xhosa people's fierce defence of their land and sovereignty, have left an indelible mark on South African history.

The Xhosa people's artistic and cultural expressions are equally noteworthy.
Traditional Xhosa music, characterised by soulful rhythms and harmonies, has captivated audiences both within and beyond South Africa. The mesmerising melodies of instruments like the umrhubhe and the uhadi have become synonymous with Xhosa culture. 

Additionally, Xhosa dance forms, such as the famous umngqungqo, have gained recognition for their energy and grace.

Literature has also been profoundly influenced by the Xhosa people. Oral traditions and storytelling have long been integral to Xhosa culture, with tales passed down through generations. The works of renowned Xhosa authors, such as S.E.K. Mqhayi and Nontsizi Mgqwetho, have made significant contributions to South African literature. These literary giants have used their words to illuminate the Xhosa experience, exploring themes of identity, resilience, and justice.

The Xhosa people have left an indelible mark on South African politics, arts, and literature. Their resistance against colonisation, vibrant cultural expressions, and literary contributions have shaped the nation's history and identity. This subchapter serves to shed light on the Xhosa influence in these areas, inviting history lovers, Xhosa people, and South Africans to delve deeper into the fascinating world of Xhosa history.

8.4. Xhosa contributions to South African History and Culture.
The Xhosa people have made remarkable contributions to South African history and culture, particularly in the realms of politics, literature, music, art, and religion. In politics, they have produced influential leaders who have played pivotal roles in the struggle for freedom, democracy, and human rights in South Africa, including Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Steve Biko, Thabo Mbeki, and Desmond Tutu. They have also actively participated in various political movements and organizations, such as the African National Congress, the Pan-Africanist Congress, the Black Consciousness Movement, and the United Democratic Front.

In the field of literature, the Xhosa people possess a rich and diverse literary heritage, encompassing both oral and written forms, which reflect their history, culture, and values. This literary tradition includes newspapers, novels, plays, poems, songs, stories, and legends, crafted in Xhosa or English. Renowned Xhosa writers such as Tiyo Soga, John Tengo Jabavu, A.C. Jordan, Nontsizi Mgqwetho, Njabulo Ndebele, Zakes Mda, and Antjie Krog have contributed significantly to this legacy.

Music is another domain where the Xhosa people have left an indelible mark. Their distinctive and influential musical style features powerful vocals and rhythmic drumming, influenced by their oral traditions, religious beliefs, and social and political struggles. Xhosa music encompasses various genres, including traditional, gospel, jazz, reggae, and hip hop, and has been brought to the world stage by exceptional artists such as Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Brenda Fassie, Freshlyground, and Simphiwe Dana.

The Xhosa people also excel in artistic expression, demonstrating their unique and creative perspective through beadwork, pottery, painting, and sculpture. Their artistic endeavors adorn clothing, accessories, and household objects, conveying messages and symbols of love, friendship, loyalty, and protection. Influenced by their cultural and spiritual beliefs, as well as social and environmental issues, Xhosa art truly captivates. Esteemed Xhosa artists such as Esther Mahlangu, Willie Bester, Zwelethu Mthethwa, and Nandipha Mntambo have masterfully contributed to this field.

Lastly, the Xhosa people's religious system is complex and diverse, comprising elements of Christianity, Islam, and traditional African beliefs. They maintain a strong belief in a Supreme Being, uQamata, whom they approach through ancestral intermediaries, honoring them with ritual sacrifices. Additionally, the Xhosa people engage in various rituals and ceremonies, such as initiation, marriage, and death, which instill moral values, social responsibility, and cultural pride in both participants and the community at large.
Chapter 9: Heritage Sites and Tourism.


9. Exploring Xhosa Historical Sites.
One of the most significant historical sites for understanding the Xhosa's early history is the Great Kei River Valley. This region marks the first point of contact between the Bantu-speaking migrants and the Khoisan hunter-gatherers. Exploring the ancient rock art and archaeological sites in this area provides valuable insights into the interactions and cultural exchanges that occurred between these two groups. 

One of the sites highlighted is the Nqabarha Cultural Landscape, which is of great significance to the Gcaleka people. This site is where King Hintsa, a revered Xhosa leader, was captured by the British during the Frontier Wars. Exploring this site allows history lovers and Xhosa people to connect with the struggles and triumphs of their ancestors.

There are also numerous towns and villages named after the forts that were built by the British colonial forces. These forts have now evolved to be names of towns and villages some of which were evolved to comemore the history of the Xhosa people. Fort Malan is one such site, my maternal village now has a memorial site for those who fought and died in some of the struggles of the Xhosa people.

Around 2008 the Eastern Cape government erected the Cattle Killing Mass Grave memorial in King William’Town to commemorate the victims of The Great Hunger which followed after Nongqawuse’s prophecy.

Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha, which was the former site of Lovedale Institution, a mission school established by Scottish missionaries in 1824. This institution played a crucial role in educating and empowering Xhosa people during a time of political and social upheaval. Today, the university is supposed to stand as a testament to the resilience and determination of the Xhosa people in preserving their cultural heritage.

Other significant sites and notable inclusions are;
The Nelson Mandela Museum, consisting of the Bhunga Building, the Qunu and Mvezo components, commemorates the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela, a revered Xhosa leader and the first democratically elected president of South Africa. It features a captivating collection of his personal belongings, photographs, documents, and artworks, providing a profound insight into his pivotal role in the fight against apartheid.

The Steve Biko Centre in Ginsberg stands as a tribute to the remarkable vision of Steve Biko, a prominent Xhosa activist and the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement. Through its museum, library, auditorium, and garden of remembrance, the center is dedicated to advancing human rights, social justice, and democracy through education, arts, and culture.

The natural wonder of the Hole in the Wall, known as esiKhaleni in Xhosa, is revered by the Xhosa people as a sacred place where the sounds of crashing waves echo through a large eroded hole in the cliff, believed to be a gateway to the realm of their ancestors.

The Xhosa Beadwork Museum in East London showcases a stunning array of traditional and contemporary Xhosa beadwork, celebrating the skill, creativity, and symbolism imbued in these intricate designs, and offering insight into the cultural significance of beadwork in Xhosa tradition through workshops and demonstrations.

Furthermore, the Xhosa clicking language, a unique linguistic and cultural heritage, continues to captivate and intrigue with its distinct use of click sounds as consonants, reflecting the rich linguistic diversity of South Africa and the Nguni language group.

9.1. Cultural tourism and community development. 
Cultural tourism is a potent force for community development, especially for indigenous communities striving to uphold their distinctive heritage and pursue economic prospects. This is notably evident in the case of the Xhosa people from South Africa, where cultural tourism has not only highlighted their profound history but also bolstered their communities.

This form of tourism allows the Xhosa people to share their remarkable narrative with the world, enabling travelers and history enthusiasts to delve into various aspects of Xhosa history, from their migration to South Africa to their encounters with the Khoisan people. Additionally, it offers the Xhosa people an opportunity to reconnect with their origins and take pride in their heritage by showcasing their traditions, language, music, and dance, ensuring the preservation and transmission of their cultural legacy to future generations.

South Africa is home to a multitude of captivating destinations that offer a glimpse into the rich culture and storied history of the Xhosa people, a prominent ethnic group in the country. Embark on a voyage of discovery as you explore these remarkable Xhosa heritage sites:

Exploration of sites to stimulate cultural tourism has a far-reaching impact on community development by creating employment opportunities, establishing tourist facilities, craft markets, and cultural centers, leading to improved living standards and overall well-being for local residents.

However, recent setbacks in South African tourism have hindered the exploration of Xhosa traditional culture. The decline in tourism not only affects the economy but also deprives visitors of the invaluable opportunity to personally experience and appreciate the richness of Xhosa tradition.

Overall, cultural tourism serves as a pivotal tool for community development among the Xhosa people. It empowers communities, fosters economic opportunities, and promotes a deeper appreciation and understanding of Xhosa culture among history enthusiasts, Xhosa people, and South Africans alike.

9.2. Celebrating Xhosa cultural festivals and events.
In the vibrant tapestry of South Africa's history, the Xhosa people have woven a
rich and captivating narrative. From their ancient origins in Central Africa as Bantu migrants to their eventual blending with the Khoisan people, the Xhosa have overcome countless challenges and emerged as a distinct and proud cultural group. 
One of the most prominent festivals in Xhosa culture is the Initiation Ceremony, also known as "Ukwaluka". This sacred rite of passage marks the transition of young Xhosa boys into manhood. It is a time of great significance and is celebrated with elaborate rituals and ceremonies. During this event, the initiates are taken to a secluded location where they undergo circumcision and are taught the values and customs of their ancestors. The entire community comes together to support and celebrate the young men, showcasing the collective strength and unity of the Xhosa people. 

Another cherished cultural event is the "Umhlanga" or Reed Dance. In 2021 the theme for the Mpondo Reed Dance was "Umgubho wentombi zamaMpondo". This colourful and vibrant festival is celebrates the young unmarried girls of the Xhosa
community. Girls from various villages gather to dance and sing, adorned in traditional attire and carrying reeds. The Reed Dance not only serves as a platform for showcasing Xhosa cultural practices but also promotes unity and camaraderie among women in the Community.

iKhwelo is the Xhosa new year celebration. It is a time of renewal and thanksgiving for the Xhosa people. The festivities usually take place in September or October, coinciding with the arrival of spring in South Africa. An important aspect of iKhwelo is the slaughtering of a cow, which symbolises the sacrifice and blessings for the year ahead. The ceremony is conducted by a traditional healer. The meat from the cow is then shared amongst the community as a symbol of unity and prosperity. iKhwelo is also a time for storytelling, traditional dances, and singing. It is an opportunity for people to reflect on the past year and set intentions for the year to come.

These are just a few examples of the many festivals and events that celebrate
the rich cultural heritage of the Xhosa people. Each occasion serves as a reminder of the resilience, unity, and pride that define the Xhosa community.

By participating in these festivals, Xhosa people not only honour their ancestors but also pass on their traditions and customs to future generations.

These festivals and events provide a unique opportunity to immerse oneself in the rich tapestry of Xhosa culture. They offer a glimpse into the historical origins of the Xhosa people, their journey from Central Africa, and their subsequent splitting into various groups. Through these celebrations, the Xhosa people continue to preserve and celebrate their unique identity, ensuring that their remarkable history remains alive for generations to come.
9.3. Conclusion: "Ungalahli imbo yakho ngophoyiyana".
I am constantly amazed by how frequently I find answers to my present-day questions by turning to the knowledge of my ancestors. This was especially true when I was deciding on the best education option for my children. Although modern tools played a role, the ultimate answer came from looking back at how my ancestors and the majority of people educated their children long before formal schooling became prevalent.

The research I've conducted for this book has been a truly enlightening experience. It has not only inspired me to explore other South African nations, clans, and tribes, but also to delve even deeper into the fascinating history and traditions of the Tshezi and Xaba tribes, but not for whom I wouldn’t be. 

I have uncovered enduring cultural practices and educational methods that have withstood the test of time, passed down from previous generations.

History has served as a wise guide, not only recounting unfolding events but also warning us against abandoning our traditions in favour of passing trends. The stories, rituals, and wisdom passed down from one generation to another have shaped not only the way children are educated but also their overall development as individuals.

Writing this book has further solidified a notion instilled in me by my parents, a belief that has guided me throughout my life: that the ties that bind humanity together are far stronger than the divisions that set us apart. 

If we were to trace our lineage for centuries, we'd find a common ancestor among the Bantu people, emphasizing our inherent bond. Yet, delving deeper into our roots to find connection with people from diverse regions as justification for unity may not necessarily forge closer ties, just like it didn't prevent the split and infighting of the Bantu people. It is through the strife between siblings, as seen in the profound story of Cain and Abel, that we witness the birth of a powerful narrative.

The true strength lies in acknowledging and embracing our shared traits today, paving the path for a prosperous society that harnesses our collective power to uplift future generations.

We have the choice to magnify the negative, but doing so would mean disregarding the positive if we want to be truthful. The clash of different tribes has caused great suffering, whether between the tribes themselves, the Khoisan, or native South Africans from the West or East. We have endured significant hardships when in conflict, yet reaped numerous benefits from coexisting and working together as South Africans.

Preserving and celebrating Xhosa culture is vital because it safeguards our heritage and identity. By passing down our customs, language, and rituals to future generations, we ensure that our unique cultural legacy remains intact. This preservation is not only for our benefit but also for the enrichment of South African society as a whole. Each culture contributes to the vibrant mosaic that makes our nation so extraordinary.

Moreover, celebrating Xhosa culture fosters a sense of unity and belonging among Xhosa people. Through cultural events, festivals, and ceremonies, we come together to honour our shared history and values. These celebrations provide an opportunity for storytelling, dancing, music, and traditional attire, reinforcing our collective identity and forging strong bonds within our community.

By understanding our historical origins and embracing our unique traditions, we honour our ancestors, strengthen our sense of identity, and contribute to the vibrant cultural fabric of South Africa. We learn from the things that work and take caution of those that didn't.

About the Author


Throughout the past two decades, I have diligently expanded my knowledge and honed my skills in the field of Risk Management across an array of industries, including government, banking, real estate, transportation, telecommunications, and consulting. My formal academic studies have provided me with a strong foundation in risk management fields such as environmental health, occupational and industrial health and safety, compliance and law, emergency response management, and business continuity.

However, it is my commitment to continuous learning and informal education that has truly broadened my knowledge and enabled me to surpass the expectations set by qualifications. I have an unquenchable thirst to understand the core principles that drive risk management across various industries. This desire arises from my ultimate objective of using these principles to improve my own life and sharing my experiences through my writing, so that others can also benefit from them.

Instead of relying on unclear anecdotes, I am dedicated to pursuing practical solutions rooted in my vast experience and continuous research, fueled by my inherent autodidactic nature. Despite the almost overwhelming temptation to conform, I make a conscious effort to challenge conventional wisdom and evaluate outcomes based on real-life experiences rather than merely hoped-for results. With my meticulous attention to detail and relentless research skills, I have thrived as an auditor, risk management, and compliance professional in the corporate world.

This has not only enabled me to excel in my formal employment endeavours but has also safeguarded my family from the prevalent pitfalls that ensnare countless others. My unwavering commitment to enhancing my skills in risk management ultimately stems from my profound dedication to excelling in my greatest passions: being a father to my son and a father figure and provider for my family.

After publishing my first book in 2023, "The Homeschooling Father, How and why I got started" I have now decided to explore, research and write about more subjects that intrigue me, of which this is one of.

Notes

“The country lying between the present colonies of the Cape and Natal was first explored by Europeans in the year 1655, and was then found to be occupied by four great tribes, 
-the Amampondomsi,
the Amampondo,
the Abatembu,
and the Amaxosa,
who formed nations as distinct from each other as are the French and the Italians.

Their language was the same, and their laws and customs varied very slightly; but in all that respected government they were absolutely independent of one another.

It has since been ascertained that the tribes further northward do not differ materially from these.”

- George McCall Theal’s Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk Tales.
Preface.
Growing up in the former Transkei, as a Xhosa native, I believed I had a deep understanding of my heritage. I grew up surrounded, mostly by individuals who lived by the old ways, “AmaQaba”. I immersed myself in the customs and traditions of yore.

The rich traditions were enthusiastically passed down through storytelling sessions beneath the moonlit sky or by the flickering fire in a cosy, albeit occasionally smoky, rondavel, creating an unforgettable atmosphere. This was a time when mobile phones were rare, radios were luxuries, and televisions were almost nonexistent. I never tire of recounting the first time I saw a television set, or at least I thought I did only to be massively disappointed since the metal thing didn’t show any images, I was around 6 years old, mistaking the antenna on the roof for the television itself because I knew no better! 

While I did not actively seek knowledge about my lineage, the profound Xhosa roots that permeated every aspect of my environment captivated my attention. However, as I entered my teenage years and moved away from the Eastern Cape, my visits back home became infrequent. I began to miss out on the subtle intricacies of our ancestral rituals and norms.

My hopes of delving deeper into written records were shattered by the scarcity and inaccessibility of books that detailed the historical evolution of the Xhosa people, whose roots can be traced back to Central and East Africa.

The biggest shock came when I read George McCall Theal’s Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk Tales. It was the first time I got an understanding of the diverse tribes present in the Xhosa community. Until then I thought all the tribes under the Xhosa nation were subgroups, with Xhosa always having existed as a nation, nothing could be further from the truth!

AmaXhosa existed as one of many tribes who were Xhosa speaking around the now Eastern Cape region of South Africa. Each tribe has its own individual identity that predates King Hintsa ka Khawuta's assimilation of the Eastern Cape tribes into the Xhosa nation from 1820 to 1835. I had never realized that Xhosa had not always been a collective name for these tribes and that they were once separate entities. As a homeschooling father, my ignorance deeply affected me.

Then there is the common ancestry between native Africans that predates the Xhosa, Zulu, Ndebele, Swazi nations in our common ancestor Mnguni. Within us all as South African Bantu tribes we have common ancestors that predates even our Nguni  ancestors from our immigration through central African from common roots. 

I am acutely aware of the irony behind the fact that the idea for this book originated from the son of a Canadian doctor who briefly lived in the United States and Sierra Leone before settling in South Africa in the 1800s. It is equally important to recognize that as I delved into my family's history, I relied heavily on technologies that are a result of the initial encounters, conflicts, but most importantly, the collaboration and lasting coexistence between my ancestors and the Western explorers of that time. Above all, these details aim to symbolize the interconnectedness among us as human beings, regardless of surface disparities, historical origins, and locations.

We can choose to amplify our differences to justify conflict between us as people, but common lineage did not prevent internal conflicts between the Bantu which led to the nations, tribes and clans we have, not only in South Africa but throughout Africa. Neither did it prevent Romulus from killing Remus despite him being his brother. Common descent even in Indian mythology rather than contribute to unity, it was the justification for the India's Caste System. Regardless of whether one embraces the scientific explanation for humanity's origins, linking all humans and life to a shared ancestor, or religious creation myths that often attribute our beginnings to a common creator, it is clear that common descent has not ensured reliable coexistence and cooperation.

The research I conducted for this book took me on an unforgettable journey through history. It reinforced to me a valuable lesson: that despite our diverse backgrounds, as South Africans, we have way more incentives to come together and strive mutually for survival and success than the alternatives. Our individuality, more than hindering our progress, has been enriching our collective experience if all things are considered.

Realizing my lack of knowledge, I understood that I need to educate myself before trying to educate my children and family. As “The Homeschooling Father”, I homeschool not only because I love teaching my kids, but also because I love learning myself. This realization prompted me to embark on a journey of discovery, which ultimately led me to create this book.

Needless to say, while conducting my research, I uncovered a wealth of information. However, this book only attempts to touch on the most significant aspects. I plan to explore further as part of this series, which will encompass not only the Xhosa nation but also the diverse nations in South Africa, from Zulu to Indian, Afrikaans and Venda, English and Pedi, Tswana and Tsonga, Swati, Sotho and Ndebele, and everyone in between.



Chapter 1: The Bantu Migration and Early Origins of the Xhosa People.



The Bantu Expansion from Central Africa.

"Clans are groups of families with different surnames but sharing one clan name. For example, 
Radebe is the clan, but the nation is called amaHlubi. 

The clan name is the name of the first ancestor or family that gave birth to the clan.

Clans make up tribes and tribes make up Nations."

SouthAfrica.net




The Xhosa people, as part of the Nguni and a subset of the Bantu, have a rich and complex history. Originating from Central Africa, the Bantu migration, characterized by shared languages and cultural customs, led to the eventual settlement of the Xhosa nation predominantly in the Eastern Cape.

This movement, which began over two millennia ago, was driven by population growth, the pursuit of arable land, and economic opportunities.

During their southward migration, the Bantu encountered the Khoisan people, resulting in cultural exchange and blending that significantly influenced the formation of the Xhosa identity. The subsequent development of distinct tribal groups within the Xhosa nation further illustrates the diversity and richness of their heritage.

Furthermore, the 16th century separation from the Zulu, stemming from political and territorial disputes, led to the establishment of individual Xhosa tribes. Despite this division, the Xhosa and the Zulu maintain a shared heritage and language, isiXhosa, symbolizing strong connections to other Bantu languages in Central Africa.

Certainly, the Xhosa people's commitment to preserving their cultural and linguistic heritage, from their Bantu origins to their interactions with the Khoisan and subsequent divergence from the Zulu, is a testament to their resilience and pride.

1.1 Arrival and Interaction with the Khoisan People.
As Bantu speakers, they gradually moved southward, settling in what is now known as the Eastern Cape province. It was during this migration that the Xhosa people came into contact with the Khoisan, the indigenous inhabitants of the region. The interaction between the Xhosa and the Khoisan was a significant chapter in the Xhosa people's history. 

The Khoisan, known for their unique language, culture, and hunter-gatherer lifestyle, had inhabited the region for thousands of years before the arrival of the Bantu-speaking Xhosa. This encounter shaped the Xhosa people's culture, language, and social dynamics, leading to a fusion of the two communities. The Xhosa and the Khoisan exchanged ideas, knowledge, and practices, resulting in a rich cultural tapestry. 

The Xhosa people adopted elements of the Khoisan language, integrating it into their own linguistic heritage. They also learned from the Khoisan's hunting and gathering techniques, adapting them to their agricultural practices. However, the relationship between the Xhosa and the Khoisan was not always harmonious. Tensions arose as the Xhosa population grew and their demand for land increased. 

This led to conflicts over territory and resources, which affected the dynamics between the two groups.

The impact of the Khoisan on the Xhosa people is so profound that even the name Xhosa is said to have come from the Khoisan language, directly translated to mean “angry men”. As you can guess this was not given in affection but rather as a result of conflicts between the people who would later be Xhosa and the Khoisan. After the Khoisan hunted domesticated cattle of the people that would later be named Xhosa conflict ensued between the two, amongst other things resulting in the Xhosa name.

1.2 Early Settlements and Tribes in the Eastern Cape.
As the Xhosa people settled in the Eastern Cape, they established various tribes that would become integral to their identity. These tribes include the amaMpondo, amaMpondomise, amaMfengu, amaJwarha, amaQwathi, amaBhaca, amaXesibe, amaBomvana, amaMbalu, amaNdlambe, amaNtinde, amaHlubi, amaZizi, amaVundle, amaGcaleka, amaNgqika, amaThembu and others . 

Each tribe had its own distinct culture, customs, and leadership structures, but they all shared a common ancestry and language. 


farmer which he is now enjoying. Even now, he continues to be the most influential man I have ever had the honor of knowing, second only to my father.

The Xaba clan's name is derived from the Zulu word "ubaba," which means father. They are closely related to the Xhosa nation through their association with the amaRharhabe royal house, which is an esteemed position within the Xhosa kingship. 

The AmaRharhabe royal house was founded by Prince Rharhabe, the son of King Phalo, who ruled the Xhosa nation in the 18th century. Prince Rharhabe and his followers settled beyond the Kei River and established their own kingdom, interacting with various tribes and clans, including the Xaba clan. Over time, the Xaba clan became allies and subjects of the amaRharhabe royal house. They adopted many Xhosa customs and traditions, cementing their connection to the royal lineage. Today, the Xaba clan remains an integral part of the amaRharhabe royal house, recognizing the authority and leadership of the Xhosa king. 

The Gcaleka tribe traces its lineage back to the famous Chief Phalo, who was the progenitor of the Xhosa nation. The Ngqika tribe, on the other hand, was renowned for its fierce resistance against colonial rule and played a significant role in the Xhosa Wars of the 19th Century. The Eastern Cape region became a melting pot of Xhosa culture, with each tribe contributing its unique traditions and practices. The Xhosa people developed a rich oral tradition, passing down their history, folklore, and values through storytelling, praise songs, and proverbs. 

Understanding the early settlements and clans in the Eastern Cape is crucial to comprehending the historical origins of the Xhosa people. It sheds light on their journey from Central Africa as Bantu, their interactions with the Khoisan, and their eventual split from the Zulu. This knowledge is not only significant for history lovers but also for Xhosa people and South Africans as a whole, as it contributes to a deeper understanding of the diverse cultural tapestry that makes up the nation. 

The Eastern Cape holds a treasure trove of history and cultural heritage, particularly regarding the early settlements and groups of the Xhosa people. Exploring this chapter of history allows us to appreciate the historical origins of the Xhosa people, their interactions with the Khoisan, and their eventual splitting into various tribes. By unravelling the complex tapestry of Xhosa history, we gain a deeper appreciation for the diverse cultural heritage of South Africa and the contributions of the Xhosa people to its rich historical narrative.
Chapter 2: Xhosa-Khoisan Relations and Interactions.


Cultural Exchange and Adaptation.

“Their most formidable foes were the San, a group of hunter gathers. The San believed that their God had given all the animals in the world for them to hunt and this included the cattle of the Chobona. 

They hunted the herds of domesticated cattle until the Chobona got angry. This lead to a bloody conflict that resulted in the crushing of the weaker San groups and the abduction of San and Khoi Khoi women and young men to serve as wives and warriors in Xhosa society. 

The San appalled at their greed and lack of generosity with their animals named these new tall and dark strangers the Xhosa: the angry men. This name stuck to Umnguni’s oldest son and he was known through the land as umXhosa the angriest of the Chobona.”
Mbuyiselo Klaas, Umzi kaPhalo	


Throughout history, the identity and heritage of the Xhosa people of South Africa have been profoundly shaped by cultural exchange and adaptation. It was enthralling to uncover, during a trip to Namibia twenty years ago, the far-reaching presence of the Xhosa people beyond the borders of South Africa, with communities extending into neighboring countries like Lesotho. Magriza can cook, a YouTube channel showcases “AmaXhosa AseZimbabwe: A Unique Cultural Experience!”.

Intermarriage played a significant role in the remarkable integration of Khoikhoi customs into the Xhosa culture. The way this would happen is that Khoikhoi individuals would marry Xhosa individuals, and vise versa, creating bonds between the two communities and facilitating cultural exchange. As a result, aspects of Khoikhoi traditions and practices became integrated into Xhosa society, enriching their cultural fabric.

The integration of the Khoisan click sounds into the Xhosa language stands out as a key aspect of this cultural exchange, setting Xhosa communication apart from other Bantu languages. 

Beyond language the Xhosa people also adopted certain musical instruments and styles from the Khoikhoi, such as the mouth bow and certain dances. Additionally, the Khoikhoi's pastoralist lifestyle and knowledge of herding and tending livestock may have influenced the Xhosa people's own practices. Moreover, the Xhosa people readily integrated the Khoikhoi's extensive understanding of plants and traditional medicinal techniques into their own healing rituals and remedies. This cultural interchange cultivated a diverse array of traditions and customs within the Xhosa community, showcasing the interdependence and common heritage of indigenous peoples across Southern Africa.

The encounter with other Bantu-speaking groups, particularly the Zulu, upon settling in the former Transkei, now known as the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, sparked further cultural exchange, leading to the development of unique customs and traditions within different Xhosa subgroups.

It is for this reason that there are a lot of commonalities between Xhosa and Zulu customs and traditions. Both cultures share similar linguistic and cultural practices, which have been influenced by their shared history and geographical proximity. Many of the traditional beliefs and rituals in Xhosa and Zulu cultures are deeply rooted in their shared Bantu heritage and have been passed down through generations. This has resulted in a strong sense of interconnectedness and mutual understanding between the two cultures.

The diversity within the Xhosa community is a testament to their adaptability and resilience as they navigated the intricate dynamics of cultural exchange and adaptation.

2.1. Conflicts and wars with the Khoisan.
The wars between the Xhosa and the Khoisan in South Africa were mainly caused by competition for land and resources. The colonial expansion of the Dutch and British powers in the Eastern Cape region also played a role. The Xhosa were agricultural and pastoral, while the Khoisan were hunter gatherers and nomads. These differences led to alliances and conflicts. The Xhosa often fought against the Zulu and the British, while the Khoisan sometimes sided with the Dutch and the British against the Xhosa. 

A conflict between the Xhosa and the Khoisan happened in 1779 when the Xhosa invaded the area where the Khoisan lived. This sparked the First Cape Frontier War, which lasted until 1781.

The Xhosa and the Khoisan clashed again in the Third Cape Frontier War (1799–1801), when the Khoisan rebelled against the Dutch and joined forces with the Xhosa. The Fourth Cape Frontier War (1811–1812) ended with the British driving the Xhosa out of the area and taking control. 

As the Xhosa and the Khoisan faced British colonial invasion, they sometimes cooperated and supported each other in resisting the British, especially during the Sixth Cape Frontier War (1834–1835) and the Eighth Cape Frontier War (1850–1853). However, there were also internal divisions and conflicts among the Xhosa and the Khoisan, as some collaborated with the British or the Boers. Ultimately, both groups lost their land and independence to the British, who annexed their territories and incorporated them into the Cape Colony.

2.2 Influence on Xhosa social structure and beliefs.
The Khoikhoi were the pioneering pastoralists in Southern Africa, introducing the notion of cattle as a symbol of wealth and status to the Xhosa. The Xhosa adopted the Khoikhoi tradition of Lobola, or bride wealth, which involved offering cattle to the bride's family as a means of compensation and alliance.

Additionally, the Khoikhoi shared religious beliefs and rituals with the Xhosa, including the belief in a supreme being called uThixo or uNkulunkulu, and the honoring of ancestors through sacrifices and ceremonies. From the Khoikhoi, the Xhosa learned the use of divination bones and herbs to connect with the spirit world and heal diseases.

Both the Khoikhoi and the Xhosa shared a common origin in the Nguni language family and influenced each other's languages over time. The Xhosa language incorporated click sounds and words from the Khoikhoi language, particularly for place names, animal names, and loanwords. In turn, the Khoikhoi language also adopted some words and grammatical structures from the Xhosa language.

Chapter 3: Xhosa-Zulu Relations and the Split into Different Xhosa tribes.


"The manner in which the Kaffirs became divided into independent tribes in ancient times is clearly shown by the law of succession to the chieftainship which is in force to the present day. 

The first wives of a chief are usually the daughters of some of his father's principal retainers; but as he increases in power his alliance is courted by great families, and thus it generally happens that the last of his wives is the highest in rank. Probably she is the daughter of a neighbouring chief, for it is indispensable in her case that the blood of the ruling line should flow in her veins. 

She is termed the great wife, and her eldest son is the principal heir. 
Another of his wives is invested at some period of his life, with the consent of his councillors and friends, with the title of wife of the right hand, and to her eldest son is allotted a portion of the tribe, with which he forms a new clan."

- George McCall Theal’s Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk Tales


Historical ties between the Xhosa and Zulu.
The Xhosa and Zulu people share a common ancestry, and for centuries, they coexisted harmoniously in what is now known as South Africa. It was during the rise of the Zulu Kingdom under the legendary King Shaka that tensions began to emerge between the two groups. 

The Xhosa people, led by their own chiefs and kings, eventually decided to break away from the Zulu Kingdom and establish their own independent communities. This development was also influenced by inter-clan conflicts, population growth, and the need for new sources of food and grazing    land. The leadership of prominent chiefs and the formation of alliances or rivalries with neighbouring groups played a significant role in shaping the Xhosa tribes. As a result, various Xhosa tribes developed distinct identities, traditions, and territories over time, contributing to the diversity within the Xhosa culture. 

The Xhosa split from the Zulu and the formation of different Xhosa tribes is believed to have occurred in the 16th century. It was influenced by a mixture of social, political, and economic factors. The Xhosa people migrated southwards from the Great Lakes region and settled in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. This split gave rise to various Xhosa tribes. 

The Mfecane or "Time of Crushing" in the early 19th century further fueled the disintegration of the Xhosa clans. This period of upheaval resulted in further fragmentation and the emergence of new groups. These new groups often formed as a result of the movement and displacement caused by the Mfecane, leading to a reshuffling of territorial boundaries and the formation of new alliances. 

The amaXhosa were one of many groups that had to adapt to the changing landscape and power dynamics during this tumultuous period. Despite the challenges, they managed to carve out their own place in the evolving social and political landscape of the region. 

One of the key figures in the formation of the amaXhosa was Chief Ngqika, who played a crucial role in uniting various Xhosa-speaking clans under a common banner. Under his leadership, the amaXhosa began to establish themselves as a formidable force in the region, challenging other rival groups and defending their Territory. They also developed strategies for coping with the changing environment, including a heightened emphasis on military prowess and diplomatic negotiations with neighbouring groups. 

This period marked a pivotal moment in the history of the AmaXhosa as they solidified their presence and influence in the region. Despite being separated, the Xhosa and Zulu people have maintained a strong cultural connection throughout history, which continues to this day. The Xhosa people, in particular, have preserved their oral traditions, storytelling, and rituals, which often reflect their historical ties to the Zulu.

3.1. Factors leading to the split.
One of the key factors that contributed to the split was the geographical expansion of the Xhosa people. As they migrated southwards, they encountered different landscapes, climate, and resources. These variations played a significant role in shaping the cultural and social dynamics of the Xhosa people. With the diverse environments they settled in, the Xhosa gradually developed distinct customs, traditions, and even dialects, leading to a natural division within the community. 

Another factor that led to the split was the influence of neighbouring groups. Over time, the Xhosa people interacted and intermingled with various communities, particularly the Khoisan people. The intermarriage and cultural exchange between the Xhosa and the Khoisan contributed to the formation of distinct subgroups within the Xhosa community. The mixing of different languages, customs, and belief systems further reinforced the development of unique identities within the Xhosa people.

Additionally, political and leadership differences played a significant role in the split of the Xhosa people. As the Xhosa society expanded, the need for effective governance became crucial. Different subgroups began to develop their own leadership structures and systems. Disagreements and conflicts over power and authority eventually led to the formation of separate factions, each with their own leaders. This division further solidified the separate identities and subgroups within the Xhosa community.

Furthermore, external influences such as colonisation and the arrival of European settlers also played a role in the Xhosa split. The intrusion of foreign powers disrupted the social and political dynamics of the Xhosa people. 

The Xhosa communities had to navigate through the complexities of colonial rule and European encroachment, resulting in further fragmentation and division within the Xhosa society. The split of the Xhosa people from the Zulu can be attributed to a combination of geographical, cultural, political, and external factors. The Xhosa people's journey from Central Africa to South Africa, their interactions with different ethnic groups, and the challenges posed by colonisation all contributed to the diversification and eventual split of the Xhosa community. Understanding these factors is essential in unravelling the rich and complex history of the Xhosa people and their contribution to the diverse tapestry of South African heritage.


3.2. Historical Conflicts and Wars between the Xhosa and the Zulu.
The Xhosa and Zulu peoples experienced conflicts that led to their separation and subsequent wars. These disputes were mainly caused by territorial disagreements, cattle raids, competition over resources, and power struggles. Furthermore, the tensions between these powerful African ethnic groups were fueled by political ambitions and leadership rivalries. Various kings and chiefs sought to expand their influence, resulting in increased friction and hostilities between the Xhosa and Zulu. 

Below is a brief summary of some major conflicts between the Xhosa and Zulu at that time; 

In the late 1700s and early 1800s, the Zulu chiefdom, under the leadership of Shaka Zulu, successfully expanded its territory and power. Shaka implemented military and political reforms, which led to conflicts with neighbouring chiefdoms, including the Xhosa, who resisted his invasions.

In 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half-brothers, Dingane and Mhlangana, who took control of the Zulu kingdom. Dingane attempted to maintain Shaka's legacy but faced challenges from internal rivals and external enemies such as the Xhosa, Boers, and the British.

In 1835, Dingane dispatched an army to attack the Xhosa chiefdom of Hintsa, who had formed an alliance with the British against the Zulu. However, the combined forces of the Xhosa and British defeated the Zulu army. Hintsa was captured and killed by the British.

In 1840, Dingane was overthrown by his half-brother, Mpande, who became the new Zulu king. Mpande aimed to avoid conflicts with the Xhosa, Boers, and British and focused on consolidating his rule and expanding his population.

In 1856, a young Xhosa girl named Nongqawuse claimed to have received a prophecy from ancestors. She instructed the Xhosa people to kill their cattle and destroy their crops in exchange for an abundant new world free from their enemies. Many Xhosa people followed Nongqawuse's instructions, leading to a devastating famine and social collapse, known as the Cattle Killing Movement. Taking advantage of the Xhosa's weakness, the Zulu king Mpande raided their lands, capturing cattle and people.

In 1879, the British Empire declared war on the Zulu kingdom with the goal of annexing it to their Natal colony. The war, known as the Anglo-Zulu War, lasted for six months and resulted in the defeat and fragmentation of the Zulu kingdom. While the Xhosa people, who had been under British rule since 1857, did not directly participate in the war, some sympathised with the Zulu's resistance.

In 1884, a Zulu prince named Dinuzulu claimed the Zulu throne with support from a group of Boer mercenaries. These mercenaries sought to gain land and influence in Zululand. However, Dinuzulu's claim was opposed by the British, who had divided Zululand into several smaller chiefdoms, as well as by his Zulu rivals competing for the throne. Dinuzulu engaged in a series of battles against his enemies but was ultimately captured and exiled by the British in 1889.



3.3. Shared customs and beliefs between the Xhosa and the Zulu nations.
Despite the historical divide, the shared lineage and enduring traditions that have surpassed conflicts and stood the test of time still unite the two nations to this day. The similarities between the Xhosa and Zulu cultures far outweigh their differences even to date, symbolizing the historical ties.

From a language perspective, the Xhosa and the Zulu languages are closely related, and they both belong to the Nguni language family. They have similar vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, but they also have some differences, such as the number of click sounds and the tone system indicating the Khoisan influence on the Xhosa.

Shared customs between the Xhosa and Zulu nations include initiation ceremonies, respect for ancestors, oral traditions, and the use of traditional medicines. Both cultures place great importance on initiation rituals, where young boys or girls transition into adulthood through various rites of passage.

Ancestor reverence is also prominent in both societies, with beliefs in the spiritual connection with deceased family members.

Oral traditions, including storytelling, praise songs, riddles, legends and proverbs, are integral to the cultural heritage of both the Xhosa and Zulu people. They also have various forms of music and dance, such as isicathamiya, maskandi, and gumboot dance. They use musical instruments, such as drums, flutes, horns, and string instruments, such as the uhadi.

Furthermore, traditional medicine plays a significant role in healing and wellness practices, incorporating the use of herbs, rituals, and spiritual guidance.

These shared customs reflect the rich cultural heritage and traditions of these two nations.
Chapter 4: The Xhosa nation, from the common ancestors to the unification under the Xhosa banner.


The foundations of the Xhosa nation, from Mnguni I.

“First of all, people must know the use of the term “Mfengu” (translated as “Fingo” in English) is an insult and there is no nation called AmamMfengu.

What happened is that during migration from Thukela, a certain group of AbaMbo arrived in Butterworth in 1828. When they were asked by Zanzolo who they were, they said: “SingAbaMbo, siyamfenguza sifuna umhlaba” (“We are AbaMbo, we are destitute, we are looking for land”).

That was the beginning of the use of the term “mfengu”, meaning “the destitute” and in the Bantu history there was never a nation called “The Destitutes”.”

The origins of the Xhosa nation can be traced back to Mnguni, with Tshawe, a direct descendant of Mnguni, being honored as the founder of the Xhosa nation after conquering the Cirha and Jwarha groups to establish the Xhosa kingdom. Cirha, the son of Xhosa and the grandson of Mnguni II, founded the amaCirha clan, one of the sub-groups of the Xhosa nation. 

His son Tshawe, who went on to defeat the Cirha and Jwarha groups, became the founder of the Xhosa kingdom. His successors expanded the kingdom's influence by settling in new territories and bringing the inhabitants under the authority of the amaTshawe, normally adopting the name of the chief under whom they had unified.

Hintsa is a descendant of Phalo ka Tshiwo, he went on to unit the different tribes under the Xhosa nation. 

4.1 The formation of the different tribes
There are many tribes under the Xhosa nation, most of which predate even the unification under the Xhosa nation. Below are some of them, this list is not exhaustive by any means. 

4.1.1 The Gcaleka Tribe
The Gcaleka Tribe history takes a significant turn with their split from the Zulu. This division occurred during the reign of King Phalo, the revered ancestor of the Xhosa people. The first time I heard of the legendary King was through greetings “Mzi ka Phalo”, which directly translates to House of Phalo signifying his contribution. 

Dissatisfied with the Zulu leadership, the Gcaleka, along with other Xhosa groups, made the decision to forge their own path, leading to the formation of distinct clans such as Bhaca, Ngqika, Thembu, Mpondomise, Mfengu, Mpondo, and Bomvana.The Gcaleka Tribe, under the leadership of Chief Gcaleka, emerged as one of the most prominent and powerful clans within the Xhosa nation. 

They established their stronghold in the Eastern Cape, becoming custodians of the land and defenders of their people. The Gcaleka Tribe played a pivotal role in the struggles against colonial forces, resisting encroachment and fighting to preserve their autonomy and traditions. 

Today, the Gcaleka people, along with other Xhosa Tribes, continue to honour their rich heritage and contribute to the vibrant tapestry of South African society. Their unique cultural practices, language, and traditional beliefs serve as a testament to their resilience and spirit.

4.1.2 Creation of the Bhaca Tribe
Among the clans that emerged from the Xhosa-Zulu split, the Bhaca Tribe holds a prominent place. Led by Chief Bhaca, they embarked on a journey of resilience and determination that shaped their unique destiny within the Xhosa nation. The Bhaca people settled in the rugged terrains of the Eastern Cape, adapting to their environment and cultivating a close connection with the land. 

The Bhaca Tribe is renowned for their deep-rooted cultural practices, including their distinctive attire, music, dance, and oral traditions. Their rich mythology, storytelling, and spiritual beliefs form an integral part of the Xhosa cultural tapestry, contributing to the preservation and celebration of their unique Heritage. 

The Bhaca Tribe has left an indelible mark on the Xhosa nation. Their warriors, known for their bravery and military prowess, played a vital role in shaping the region's history. They defended their lands against external threats and played a significant role in the resistance against colonial rule. 

Today, the Bhaca people continue to contribute to the socio-economic development of South Africa, excelling in various fields and upholding their cultural legacy. The creation of the Bhaca Tribe stands as a testament to the resilience and unwavering spirit of the Xhosa people. Their journey from Central Africa to South Africa, their encounter with the Khoisan, and their split from the Zulu kingdom highlight the complexity and diversity of their History.

4.1.3. Emergence of theNgqika Tribe.
The Ngqika Tribe, led by Chief Ngqika, emerged as one of the prominent factions during this period of political upheaval. Chief Ngqika was known for his strong leadership and strategic alliances, which allowed the Ngqika Tribe to assert its influence in the region. 

They played a crucial role in resisting the colonial expansion of the British and Dutch settlers, fighting to protect their land and preserve their cultural heritage. The Ngqika Tribe's history is intertwined with the broader struggles of the Xhosa people against colonialism and oppression. They faced numerous challenges, including land dispossession, forced labour, and cultural assimilation. 

Despite these hardships, the Ngqika Tribe and other Xhosa subgroups have managed to preserve their distinct identities and traditions.Today, the Ngqika Tribe continues to play an important role within the Xhosa community and South African society as a whole. Their history serves as a reminder of the resilience and perseverance of the Xhosa people in the face of adversity. 

By understanding the emergence of the Ngqika Tribe, we gain valuable insights into the historical origins of the Xhosa people and their ongoing quest for self determination and cultural pride. This subchapter is dedicated to all history lovers, Xhosa people, and South Africans who seek a deeper understanding of the historical origins of the Xhosa people and the rich tapestry of their diverse subgroups. It aims to provide a comprehensive account of the emergence of the Ngqika Tribe within the broader context of Xhosa history, shedding light on their contributions, struggles, and triumphs throughout the centuries.

4.1.4. Founding of the Thembu Tribe.
The Xhosa people were initially united under a strong central authority, led by a king or paramount chief. However, internal conflicts and external pressures eventually led to the fragmentation of the Xhosa into several distinct clans. One of these clans was the Thembu. 

Ngubengcuka was known for his wise leadership and diplomatic skills. He was able to navigate the complex political landscape of the time, forging alliances and negotiating with both the British colonisers and rival Xhosa Tribe. Under his rule, the Thembu Tribe flourished, becoming one of the most influential and respected clans in Xhosa society. 

Today, the Thembu people continue to maintain a strong sense of cultural identity and pride in their history. They have made significant contributions to South African society, with prominent figures such as Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu being members of the Thembu Tribe. The founding of the Thembu Tribe is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the Xhosa people. 

It highlights the complex historical origins of the Xhosa, from their migration from Central Africa as Bantu, their interactions with the Khoisan, and their eventual split from the Zulu. Understanding the founding of the Thembu Tribe is crucial in unravelling the rich tapestry of Xhosa history, and it serves as a reminder of the diverse and interconnected nature of South Africa's cultural heritage.

4.1.5. Establishment Tribe of the Mpondomise.
The Mpondomise Tribe, led by Chief Mpondombini, emerged as one of the prominent factions following the split. They settled in the lush and fertile lands of the Eastern Cape, where they established their own distinct community. 

The Mpondomise people became known for their agricultural prowess, cultivating crops such as maize and millet, which not only sustained their own community but also contributed to the broader Xhosa economy. Throughout their existence, the Mpondomise Tribe faced numerous challenges, including conflicts with neighbouring clans and the encroachment of European colonisers. 

Despite these obstacles, the Mpondomise people remained resilient and steadfast in preserving their cultural heritage. They continued to pass down their traditional customs, oral histories, and rituals from one generation to the next, ensuring the survival of their unique identity. Today, the Mpondomise Tribe stands as a testament to the rich history and cultural diversity of the Xhosa people. 

Their distinct traditions, beliefs, and contributions continue to shape the tapestry of South African society. As history lovers, Xhosa people, and South Africans, we must cherish and celebrate the establishment of the Mpondomise Tribe as a crucial milestone in the Xhosa people's journey from Central Africa to South Africa.

4.1.6. Origins of the Mfengu Tribe.
I have vivid memories of a childhood friend from eDrayini, who used to speak passionately about visiting his relatives in "emaMfengwini", referring to the place of the Mfengus. Back then, this held little significance for me, but recently everything fell into place. Given that Drayini is a rural village under Dutywa, Zola's reference to emaMfengwini indicated a location towards Butterworth. When considering the historical background of the Mfengu, everything now falls into place.

In 1828, a group of AbaMbo sought refuge in Butterworth, escaping the tumult of the Mfecane. Hailing from the Thukela River valley in present-day KwaZulu-Natal, they were part of the Nguni group of Bantu-speaking people.

Their settlement in the Ciskei and Transkei regions allowed them to prosper as farmers and traders. They embraced Christianity and Western education, producing some of the earliest political leaders among the Cape Africans. Today, they are an integral part of South African society, boasting a diverse and prosperous history and culture. While some have integrated into the Xhosa nation, others have maintained their unique identity and autonomy.

The journey of the Mfengu tribe is punctuated by numerous obstacles and opportunities in the modern era. A key challenge they face is their intricate relationship with the Xhosa, who are both their kin and former adversaries. Some have assimilated into the Xhosa community, while others proudly uphold their distinct identity and autonomy.

Their struggle for land and political rights has been an enduring battle against apartheid, the Bantustan system, and the post-apartheid government. While some have advocated for their own homeland, others have pursued integration within democratic South Africa, striving for fair representation.

Furthermore, the social and economic progress of the Mfengu tribe has been shaped by their unique historical legacy, cultural values, and present-day challenges. While some have achieved remarkable success and recognition in various fields, others continue to grapple with poverty and marginalization.

The Mfengu tribe, with its diverse and rich heritage, significantly enriches the complexity and vibrancy of South African society. They have played a pivotal role in shaping the history and politics of the region, leaving an indelible mark on the nation's tapestry.

4.1.7. Development of the Mpondo Tribes.
The interaction between the Xhosa and the Khoisan had a significant impact on the development of the Mpondo Tribe. This cultural fusion contributed to the distinct identity of the Mpondo Tribe. 

After their defeat at the hands of the renowned Zulu leader Shaka, the Mpondo tribe experienced immense turmoil and displacement. The period of Mfecane brought about significant challenges for the Mpondo people, as they were forced to migrate and their community fragmented. They struggled to cope with the loss of their land and traditional way of life. Many Mpondo communities were scattered across different regions, which made it difficult to maintain their unity and tribal identity.

However, in 1828, under the leadership of the great Faku, the Mpondo people found a way to reorganize and rise again, despite their previous hardships. Faku demonstrated remarkable insight by learning from history and adopting some of the successful war strategies used by Shaka's army, which had previously led to their downfall. As a result, the Mpondo people flourished under Faku's leadership.

By 1860, their population had grown to around 100,000, and they had become a formidable state with the ability to engage in trade with European traders during the 1860s.

Unfortunately, the Mpondo people would face further challenges and ultimately succumb to Cecil Rhodes, largely due to internal conflicts within their own groups, which weakened them. Despite these setbacks, the Mpondo people exhibited incredible bravery as they persevered and adapted to their new circumstances. They tenaciously held onto their cultural heritage, preserving their language, customs, and traditional practices, which played a vital role in keeping their community alive amid the chaos of displacement.

4.1.8. Formation of the Bomvana Tribe.
As a member of the Tshezi clan, I trace my roots to the Bomvana tribe. "Tshezi, Jalamba, Mqal’ ongangenduku, Njilo-njilo, iNkonjane emnyama ebhab’ emafini, iinzwana zakwaBomvana, iNyoka emnyama ecanda isiziba, inkosi ezingazange zibutheng’ubokhosi Zinto ezityhafileyo ingathi zidla umcuku. " These are just some of the praises we recite when recounting our history through the practice of "ukuzithutha". 

I never understood much about why we went through all the names we do until I saw that amongst my ancestors, Njilo is one, hence the emphasis and repeated praise in "Njilo Njilo". Bomovana is highly praised in the process as well signifying the link.. 

AmaBomvana were forced out of Pondoland and settled in the area east of the Mbashe river. They formed a relationship with the Gcaleka and received permission from King Hintsa. 

They have a historical connection with other groups like AmaMpondomise, AmaXesibe, AbakwaMkhize, and AmaMpondo, as they share cultural similarities.



4.2. Hintsa ka Khawuta: The Great King of the Xhosa Nation
Hintsa ka Khawuta, or King Hintsa, was the great of the Xhosa Kingdom, originally founded by his great ancestor, King Tshawe. His reign, from 1820 until 1835, saw the Xhosa Kingdom at its pinnacle, stretching from the Mbhashe River in the south of Mthatha to the Gamtoos River in the Southern Cape. Hintsa oversaw one of the most formidable kingdoms in Southern Africa, eventually engaging in a century-long conflict with the British Empire and their expansion across the region.

The Xhosa Kingdom was governed by two houses, the Gcaleka House or Great House, serving as the ruling house, and the Rharhabe House or right-hand house, as the second senior house. During Hintsa's reign, tributary states such as AbaThembu, AmaMpondo, AmaBomvana, AmaBhaca, and AmaMpondomise acknowledged the authority of the Xhosa Kingdom. These states, although ethnically Xhosa, maintained their autonomy within the kingdom.

Born around 1780, Hintsa was the son of Khawuta ka Gcaleka, descending from a long line of notable rulers. He succeeded his uncle Nqoko ka Gcaleka, the regent king, and was officially crowned in 1820. Hintsa is often compared to his remarkable great-ancestor, Tshawe kaNkosiyamntu, who founded the Xhosa kingdom in the late 17th century by defeating rival groups. Hintsa inherited a prosperous and sizable kingdom, which he skillfully maintained and fortified using his diplomacy and military expertise. His people held him in high regard, and his influence extended beyond his own kingdom to other African kingdoms and chiefs. Even his adversaries, such as the British and the Boers, recognized his authority and respected his strength.

Under Hintsa's leadership, the Xhosa army was one of the largest and most formidable in Southern Africa. His military strategy centered around mobility, surprise attacks, and guerrilla tactics. Rather than engaging in direct conflict, Hintsa preferred to harass and raid his enemies from a distance. His army comprised warriors from various tribes and clans who followed his leadership and command. He also garnered support from allies and tributaries from other African kingdoms in times of war.

During Hintsa's reign, the Xhosa Kingdom found itself in conflict with the Cape Colony, which was under British rule. Additionally, the Xhosa nation faced internal tensions due to civil wars among chiefs and the influx of refugee tribes from the Mfecane. These factors led to a series of wars, known as the Frontier Wars or the Xhosa Wars, spanning over a century. 

The pivotal event that sparked the Sixth Frontier War, also known as the Hintsa War, was the murder of a high-ranking Xhosa chief by a Cape government commando party. This act of aggression provoked the Xhosa people, resulting in an army of 10,000 men, led by Rharhabe chief Maqoma, launching an assault on the Cape Colony. The British eventually intervened, halting their advance after extensive pillaging, burning, and loss of life.

These conflicts were characterized by brutal fighting, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. Sir Harry Smith and Sir Benjamin d'Urban, leading British troops, sought Help from Hintsa to attack the Rharhabe chiefs. Initially willing to support the British with 1,000 men, it became clear that Hintsa would not betray his fellow Xhosa leaders. This led to d'Urban using it as an excuse to declare war on Hintsa.

British governor Sir Benjamin D'Urban confronted King Hintsa with a substantial army, holding him responsible for attacks on the Cape Colony due to his paramount authority over the Xhosa nation and its chiefdoms. Rather than escalating the conflict, Hintsa chose to engage in peace talks with the British. In May 1835, Hintsa, accompanied by British soldiers led by Governor Harry Smith, participated in peace negotiations. However, the British demands proved to be unreasonable and intended to humiliate and weaken Hintsa.

Sensing this, Hintsa refused to yield and decided to terminate the negotiations. As he left, British soldiers captured him and held him as a hostage. They forced him to march alongside the British army, subjecting him to torture and abuse. During this time, his kingdom was ravaged by British troops, resulting in the destruction of villages, loss of lives, and seizures of cattle. Despite numerous escape attempts, Hintsa was recaptured and assaulted. On May 12, 1835, Hintsa managed to break free and fled toward a nearby river.

Pursued by Smith and his men, he was fatally shot in the back. In a final act of barbarity, Smith ordered Hintsa's ears to be severed as evidence of his death. His head was also detached and taken as a gruesome trophy. Hintsa's body was left unburied, while his head was later displayed in a museum in Britain.

Hintsa's death stands as a tragic and disgraceful event in the history of the Xhosa people and the British Empire. It symbolized the end of Xhosa resistance and independence, giving way to a period of colonial domination and oppression. Nevertheless, Hintsa's legacy endures in the memories and culture of the Xhosa people, who consider him a heroic martyr.

He remains a potent symbol of African dignity, sovereignty, and a source of inspiration in the struggle against colonialism and apartheid. After a prolonged campaign by the Xhosa people and the South African government, Hintsa's head was finally returned to South Africa in 1996. It was laid to rest with full honors in his ancestral land, allowing his spirit to find peace at last.

Chapter 5: Socio-Political Organization and Leadership within the Xhosa tribes.


Traditional Governance Structures
Traditional governance structures have played a significant role in shaping the history and identity of the Xhosa people of South Africa. These structures have evolved over centuries and continue to hold great importance to this day.

Traditional governance structures among the Xhosa people are characterized by a strong emphasis on kinship and communal decision-making. The chief or king, often referred to as the Inkosi, plays a pivotal role in maintaining social order and resolving disputes within the community. The Inkosi is assisted by a council of elders, who offer guidance and wisdom based on their wealth of experience and knowledge.

Furthermore, the Xhosa people have a deep connection to their ancestral spirits, which are believed to influence their daily lives and provide guidance to their leaders. Traditional ceremonies and rituals, such as the ukubuyisa or ancestral homecoming, reinforce this spiritual connection and strengthen the bond between the living and the deceased.
While modern governance structures have been introduced in South Africa, the traditional governance systems of the Xhosa people continue to hold significant cultural and symbolic value. They serve as a reminder of the rich history and heritage of the Xhosa people and provide a sense of identity and belonging to Xhosa individuals.
5.1. Roles and responsibilities of clan leaders.
The Xhosa nation encompasses a diversity of tribes and clans that share a  connection through their ancestry and culture. At the heart of this nation are the leaders, who have long served as the esteemed leaders of their respective tribes and clans. These remarkable individuals have historically played pivotal roles in shaping the political, social, and religious landscape of the Xhosa people. 

Throughout history, the tribe and clan leaders have been entrusted with important responsibilities. They have stood as stalwart representatives, engaging in negotiations and interactions with other tribes, clans, and colonial authorities. When sincere, these leaders have diligently worked to maintain the unity, harmony, and well-being of their people by skillfully resolving disputes, enforcing laws, and ensuring protection for all. 

The tribe and clan leaders have also held sacred roles in their culture's traditions. They have dutifully presided over the traditional courts, ceremonies, and rituals that formed the fabric of Xhosa society. From the significant rites of initiation, marriage, and burial, these leaders have been instrumental in upholding and perpetuating the cultural practices that define the Xhosa people. In doing so, they have fostered a deep respect for ancestral heritage, unwavering loyalty to the tribe, and a steadfast devotion to the Xhosa language and dress.

In accordance with the patrilineal system of succession, the tribe and clan leaders have inherited their esteemed positions from their fathers or other male relatives, ensuring a sense of continuity and stability within their leadership. 

In democratic South Africa the relevance of the traditional leaders has growingly been questioned. The relevance of amakhosi or inkosi has come under scrutiny by many, especially due to the substantial taxpayer funds they receive, with little impact on alleviating poverty even in the rural areas they represent. This also brings up an important question for taxpayers across the nation who are not associated with the Eastern Cape or the Xhosa people, why should they have to bear the weight of something that does not concern them? 

Traditional leaders primarily advocate for their own communities and tribes, not comprehensively representing the entire country's population, so why should the burden be shouldered by individuals who do not receive any benefits from the traditional leaders?

5.2. Clan Hierarchy and Power Dynamics.
The principle of seniority forms the basis of the Xhosa tribe hierarchy and power dynamics. 

The tribe that can trace its lineage back to the oldest ancestor or the first-born son of the common ancestor holds authority over the clans, along with the right to leadership and prestige. This tribe also takes on the responsibility of protecting and guiding the clans. In Xhosa culture, the tribe that holds this responsibility is known as the "Great House". 

They are not only guardians of tradition and values but also arbiters in settling disputes and making important decisions for the entire tribe. Their role as the "Great House" encompasses not only leadership but also upholding the spiritual and cultural practices that define the tribe's people, ensuring continuity and preservation of their heritage for future generations. This esteemed position comes with immense respect, but also a weighty burden, as the tribe looks to them for guidance and unity in times of both celebration and challenge. 

The Xhosa clan hierarchy and power dynamics are not only determined by the principle of seniority but are also influenced by historical events and political alliances. Wars and conflicts over land, cattle, and leadership have led to divisions and rivalries between some tribes. Additionally, alliances formed with other tribes, clans, or colonial powers have affected their status and influence in Xhosa society.

5.3. Evolution of leadership in modern Xhosa society.
Tribe and clan leaders, also known as amakhosi or inkosi, have wielded significant influence in the realms of politics, society, and religion among the Xhosa people. They have played pivotal roles in fostering relationships with other groups and colonial authorities, leaving a lasting impact on the Xhosa society as a whole. 

However, the Xhosa society has also experienced the tumultuous influence of colonialism and apartheid. These systems disrupted and altered the traditional structures and customs of the Xhosa people, introducing new forms of governance and administration.

In the face of challenges such as land dispossession, taxation, migration, education, and resistance, Xhosa leaders had to adapt and respond accordingly. Some leaders chose to collaborate with colonial and apartheid regimes, while others opposed and resisted them. 

Furthermore, following the end of apartheid in 1994, the Xhosa society embarked on a democratic transition that presented both opportunities and challenges for the Xhosa people and their leaders. While the Xhosa people gained increased political rights, representation, and access to education, health, and development, they also had to confront pressing issues such as poverty, unemployment, inequality, corruption, and violence.

Xhosa leaders found themselves in the delicate position of balancing the expectations and demands of their people with the requirements and regulations of the democratic state. In addition to these historical factors, the Xhosa society has also been influenced by the forces of globalisation and modernization. These processes have exposed the Xhosa people and their leaders to new ideas, values, and influences, resulting in a greater diversity and heterogeneity within the Xhosa society. 

As the Xhosa people adopt different lifestyles, identities, and aspirations, Xhosa leaders are challenged with managing this complexity and diversity, while also navigating the intricacies of competition and cooperation with other groups and actors.

5.4. Impact of the South African Constitution on Xhosa customs and laws. 
The South African Constitution and laws have had a profound impact on the traditional legal systems of the Xhosa people. This has been both positive and negative.

Prior to the arrival of colonial rule, the Xhosa had well-established customary laws and systems of justice that governed their society. However, with the establishment of a centralised legal system under British rule and the subsequent codification of laws, the traditional legal systems of the Xhosa underwent significant changes. 

One of the major impacts of the South African Constitution on Xhosa legal systems is the recognition of customary law. The Constitution acknowledges customary law as a valid source of legislation and highlights the importance of preserving cultural and traditional practices. This recognition has allowed certain aspects of Xhosa customary law to be incorporated into the broader legal framework of South Africa. These rights have had a significant impact on the traditional legal systems of the Xhosa, as they have prompted a reevaluation of certain practices and norms within their traditional customs. 

Additionally, the South African legal system has established mechanisms for resolving disputes in accordance with customary law.These mechanisms, including the establishment of traditional courts, aim to maintain the integrity of Xhosa legal traditions while operating within the broader constitutional framework. 

However, it should be noted that the impact of the South African Constitution and laws on Xhosa legal systems has not been without challenges. There have been debates and tensions regarding the balance between preserving cultural traditions and upholding constitutional rights, particularly in cases where traditional practices may conflict with constitutional principles.

Regarding criminal law, conflicts have arisen surrounding issues like corporal punishment and customary penalties, which may contradict the constitutional prohibition of cruel and inhuman punishment. The challenge lies in striking a balance between respecting cultural traditions and safeguarding individual rights within the broader legal framework. 

In terms of property law, conflicts arise when traditional practices, such as communal land ownership, clash with individual property rights recognized by the constitution. This has led to complex legal battles and the need for innovative solutions that bridge the gap between cultural preservation and constitutional protections. 

The conflict between traditional Xhosa practices and modern South African law is an ongoing and intricate issue. This creates tension between the Xhosa community's desire to preserve their cultural heritage and the government's obligation to protect individuals from Harm. 

The practice of ukuthwala, in which young women are kidnapped for marriage, is another traditional practice that is in conflict with the law and widely frowned upon today. It involves forcibly taking a girl or woman against her will, often resulting in forced marriages and severe emotional and physical abuse. Activists and organisations have made efforts to raise awareness and advocate for the eradication of this practice. 

While male circumcision for the Xhosa is still legal, there has been increasing condemnation of this practice due to the numerous initiates who have died or faced health complications, some with lasting physical impairments. In 2021, Dispatch Live reported that the number of deaths of Xhosa initiates had reached 858 in the previous 15 years. This alarming figure has continued to rise, exceeding 900 by the end of 2023. This trend emphasizes the urgent need for increased regulation and oversight of the traditional initiation process.

There are signs that the Xhosa customary law conflict is on its way to being resolved. However, instead of customary law taking a leading role whenever it is appropriate, it is more likely that its elements will be incorporated into national law, albeit loosely. As a result, traditional structures will slowly diminish over time. 

An aspect of customary law that I find problematic is how immovable property is collectively managed. 

This approach has led to a significant decrease in investment in rural South Africa as property investment lacks security of tenure. The communal property system in rural South Africa is detrimental to investment and disrespectful to rural property owners. This system hampers economic development in rural areas by discouraging private investment and stifling entrepreneurship. It deprives property owners of the autonomy and control over their land, hindering them from fully utilising it for productive purposes. 

Furthermore, the lack of clear land ownership rights hinders the ability to access credit and loans, which hampers investment and limits economic growth. In law, individuals who rely on others to handle their affairs often face obstacles in making decisions for themselves, primarily due to factors such as age, mental incapacity, or other forms of incapability. The communal property system in rural areas implies that adults who have been managing their affairs for centuries lack the capacity to manage their own assets.

This system is an insult to rural property owners who should have the right to make decisions about their land and benefit from its use. It perpetuates inequality and prevents the accumulation of wealth and assets among rural communities. Overall, the communal property system in rural South Africa is detrimental to investment and undermines the rights and potential of rural property owners. 

This is one of the aspects that few would miss in modern day South Africa as it has been a huge impediment.
Chapter 6: Cultural Traditions and Practices.
“If you come to me but will not leave your family, you cannot be my follower. You must love me more than your father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters—even more than your own life!”
 Luke 14:26




Language, beliefs and heritage.

The Xhosa people not only share commonalities with other Nguni people and the broader Bantu community, but also possess distinctive characteristics that distinguish them. These distinctions not only differentiate them from other Nguni nations but also within the various tribes that comprise the Xhosa nation.

The Xhosa nation's rich cultural heritage is evident in their traditional clothing, music, and dance, which are all integral parts of their identity. This strong sense of cultural pride and heritage has played a significant role in shaping the Xhosa community. Their traditional clothing, music, and dance reflect their deep connection to their history and values, providing a cohesive thread that binds the community together across generations. This preservation and celebration of their cultural heritage continues to be a source of strength and resilience for the Xhosa people.

The food they have adapted to consider as a staple was largely shaped by the offerings available within the different areas, hence even though you will see many commonalities between dishes and traditions there are subtle differences from place to place.

The variability in Xhosa traditions can be attributed to the adaptable oral traditions that have been a fundamental source of knowledge for African peoples over the centuries. Initially, I perceived the absence of written records as a vulnerability, potentially paving the way for misinterpretation and exploitation. However, I now understand that this lack of documentation has enabled Xhosa traditions to evolve and remain relevant in response to societal and environmental changes.

The existence of ancient written records has presented a challenge for those who seek to adhere strictly to their literal meanings in a changing world. Scholars have had to provide interpretations to adapt these writings to current times, which I suspect is the reason there is the Old Testament and the New Testament, as well as various Christian church denominations aiming to serve their specific followers through scripture interpretation.

6.1. Xhosa language and communication.
IsiXhosa, also known as the Xhosa language, holds a significant place as one of the official languages of South Africa and Zimbabwe. It belongs to the Nguni group of Bantu languages, which includes Zulu, Swati, and Ndebele. Across the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Gauteng, and Free State provinces of South Africa, as well as in parts of Zimbabwe and Lesotho, the Xhosa language is spoken by approximately 17 million individuals.

The Xhosa language took root during the movement of the Nguni people from Central and East Africa to Southern Africa between the 10th and 15th centuries. As the Nguni people interacted with the Khoikhoi and the San, the indigenous inhabitants of the region, they incorporated some of their words and click sounds. Over time, different subgroups emerged, such as the Xhosa, Zulu, Swati, and Ndebele, each bringing forth its own dialects and cultures.

Characterized by its intricate phonology, morphology, and syntax, the Xhosa language boasts 26 letters from the Latin alphabet, even though some are pronounced differently from English. With 18 consonants and 10 vowels, which can be either short or long, Xhosa is classified as a tonal language. This means that the pitch of one's voice can change the meaning of a word. The Xhosa language encompasses two fundamental tones: high and low.

A distinguishing feature of the Xhosa language lies in the use of click sounds, created by suction inside the mouth. Dental, alveolar, and lateral clicks form the three types of clicks in Xhosa. The dental click occurs when the tongue's tip is placed behind the upper front teeth and released with a sucking sound. The alveolar click happens when the tongue's tip rests on the alveolar ridge, just behind the upper front teeth, and is released with a popping sound. Lastly, the lateral click takes place when the sides of the tongue rest on the molars and are released with a smacking sound. These clicks can be modified by adding other consonants or vowels before or after them.

Xhosa's agglutinative morphology, wherein words are formed by adding prefixes and suffixes to roots, is another notable attribute. This language embodies 15 noun classes, marked by prefixes indicating the number, gender, and category of the noun. For instance, the prefix "um-" signifies a singular noun of class 1, typically relating to humans or animals, while the prefix "aba-" represents a plural noun of class 2, belonging to the same category as class 1. Furthermore, Xhosa possesses a complex verb system encompassing a range of aspects, moods, tenses, and voices. By adding various prefixes and suffixes to the verb "ukubona" (to see), different meanings can be expressed, such as "ndiyakubona" (I see you), "andiyikubona" (I do not see you), "ndiyakubonisa" (I show you), "ndiyakubonwa" (I am seen by you), and so on.

The Xhosa language draws influence from its history, culture, and society. Due to trade, colonization, migration, and globalization, it has borrowed words from various languages, including English, Afrikaans, Dutch, Portuguese, Arabic, and Hindi.

Xhosa also reflects the values, beliefs, and traditions of the Xhosa people, who possess a strong sense of identity and belonging. The language is used to convey respect, dignity, and unity among the Xhosa community, as well as to communicate with their ancestors and their God. Moreover, Xhosa plays a vital role in creating and preserving the oral literature of the Xhosa people, such as proverbs, idioms, praise names, poems, songs, stories, and legends.

In contemporary South African society, the Xhosa language continues to hold relevance and exert influence, contributing to the nation's diversity, unity, and development. Recognized as one of the 11 official languages in the South African Constitution, Xhosa is employed across various domains, including education, media, politics, business, and arts. It is taught as a subject in many schools and is supported by numerous organizations and institutions.

The Xhosa language instills pride and strength within the Xhosa people and serves as a source of inspiration and learning for others.

As a living and dynamic language, Xhosa adapts and evolves with the changing times without compromising its core features and functions. It celebrates and upholds diversity while nurturing unity.

6.2. Traditional beliefs and spirituality.
"Qamata" is a Xhosa deity or supreme being, while "Thixo" refers to God in line with Christian beliefs, likely introduced by missionaries. 

"Qamata" is more closely associated with the traditional Xhosa belief system and "Thixo" being a widely used term for God in the Xhosa Language. Qamata is seen as an omnipresent force, both benevolent and malevolent, who governs the world and influences the destiny of individuals. An integral aspect of Xhosa spirituality is the veneration of ancestors.

Ancestors are believed to be intermediaries between the living and Qamata, wielding  significant influence on human affairs. The Xhosa people believe that ancestors possess the power to bless or curse their descendants, depending on their behaviour and adherence to traditional values. Ancestors are consulted and honoured through rituals, prayers, and offerings, as they are seen as protectors and providers of guidance. 

However, the influence of Christianity has had a profound impact on Xhosa spirituality. With the arrival of European settlers and missionaries, Christianity was introduced to the Xhosa community. Many Xhosa people have embraced Christianity and integrated it into their spiritual practices.

Today, a significant portion of Xhosa people identify themselves as Christians while still attempting to maintain a connection to their ancestral beliefs. The influence of Christianity on Xhosa spirituality has not been without tensions. Traditionalists, like myself, believe that Christianity has weakened their ancestral beliefs and undermines the true essence of their spirituality.

Despite the effort to reconcile the Xhosa belief system with Christianity, the reality is that the two are not compatible. Christianity and traditional Xhosa belief systems often clash due to their different perspectives on authority and spiritual connection. Christianity centres around the authority figure of Jesus to connect to God, while Xhosa tradition emphasises connecting with Qamata through family and ancestors. 

A conflict with one's family, whether they are alive or deceased, often leads to a diminished or even broken bond with Qamata in the Xhosa community. However, in Christianity, it is quite the opposite. In fact, relinquishing one's family is seen as a prerequisite to demonstrate unwavering devotion to Jesus.
Yes, for this reason, the two belief systems are incompatible, leading most individuals to ultimately embrace Christianity while Qamata fades into memory.  These contrasting views create tension between the two belief systems, leading to conflicts within the Xhosa community.

Christian missionaries have sought to convert Xhosa people to their faith, which has disrupted the traditional practices and deep-rooted beliefs of the Xhosa culture. The clash between Christianity and traditional Xhosa belief systems raises questions of cultural preservation and the right to one's own spiritual practices. This ongoing conflict symbolises the broader struggle between Western ideologies and indigenous cultures, as Christianity represents the dominant, foreign religion, while Xhosa tradition reflects the cultural heritage of the people. The rise of fake prophets and their churches in the Eastern Cape has taken advantage of people's poverty and desperation, exploiting their vulnerability for personal gain.

These so-called prophets often manipulate followers into giving large sums of money or other valuable assets in exchange for false promises of wealth or healing. As a result, many individuals and families are left in even greater financial distress after being deceived by these fraudulent practices. Xhosa spirituality is a complex tapestry that weaves together belief in Qamata, ancestral veneration, while trying to navigate the influence of religion.

The Xhosa people also have a deep connection to nature and the elements. They believe in the presence of ancestral spirits in natural phenomena such as rivers, mountains, and trees. These natural elements are considered sacred and are often sites of rituals and ceremonies. Traditional healers play a crucial role in Xhosa society. They possess specialised knowledge and skills to communicate with the spirits, diagnose illnesses, and provide remedies. The Xhosa people have immense faith in the healing powers of these traditional healers, who are respected and revered for their wisdom and abilities.

6.3. Rites of passage and initiation ceremonies.
The Xhosa people have a rich cultural heritage that is deeply rooted in various rites of passage. These rituals have been practised for centuries and continue to hold great significance in Xhosa society, both historically and in the present. One of the most renowned and significant rites of passage among the Xhosa is the initiation ceremony known as "ulwaluko."

This ritual marks the transition of young boys into manhood and is considered a crucial milestone in a Xhosa man's life. During ulwaluko, boys, as in amakhwenkwe, are taken to isolated initiation schools, where they undergo circumcision and are taught about their cultural heritage, responsibilities, and obligations as men in Xhosa society. Another important rite of passage is the initiation of girls, known as "intonjane." Intonjane is focused on teaching girls about womanhood, traditional values, and skills essential for their roles as wives and mothers.
 
Weddings also hold significant importance in Xhosa culture, symbolising the transition from being single to being married. Intonjane is a rite of passage for girls practised by some of the peoples of South Africa including the Xhosa nation. In Xhosa, “intombi” refers to a girl and “njane” is used to denote something small, thus a direct translation of Intonjane would be young girl.The practice is done when a girl goes through her first menstruation. It is a significant cultural practice that marks the transition from a young girl, to a young woman that can potentially marry. During the Intonjane ceremony, the girl is secluded and taught various skills, traditions, and responsibilities that are expected of a young woman in Xhosa culture. The purpose is to prepare her for adulthood and ensure that she is equipped with the necessary knowledge to navigate through life.

Intonjane held great value among the Xhosa people, particularly in the past, as it played a crucial role in promoting family cohesion and creating a nurturing environment for raising children. Following Intonjane, young women were prepared for marriage, significantly reducing the likelihood of them having children outside of wedlock. Not only did Intonjane prepare young women for marriage, but it also instilled values such as responsibility, respect, and loyalty, which were essential in maintaining healthy relationships within the Xhosa community. 

Ulwaluko and intonjane mark the transitions into adulthood for boys and girls, respectively, while traditional Xhosa weddings celebrate the union of two individuals. These important ceremonies help maintain and honour the cultural heritage of the Xhosa people, ensuring that their customs and traditions remain vibrant and cherished in the modern world.

6.4. Xhosa Arts and Crafts.
Xhosa arts and crafts have long played a significant role in the cultural identity of the Xhosa people. These artistic expressions encompass a wide range of disciplines, including bead work, pottery, woodcarving, and weaving. Xhosa artisans use vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and symbolism to create unique and meaningful pieces. These are often inspired by nature, spirituality, and traditional Xhosa beliefs, infusing their creations with rich cultural significance and historical resonance.

The art of bead work in Xhosa culture is particularly noteworthy, with beads being used to represent important aspects of life such as status, age, and marital status. Each bead colour and pattern carries its own significance, making every piece of bead work a visual narrative of the individual's story. The intricate patterns and meticulous craftsmanship of Xhosa beadwork reflect the deep respect for tradition and community that lies at the heart of Xhosa culture.

Pottery and weaving are also important forms of artistic expression in Xhosa culture, with pottery vessels and woven baskets showcasing the skilled craftsmanship of the Xhosa people. Pottery, often adorned with intricate patterns and symbols, serves as both functional items for daily use and artwork that preserves the cultural heritage of the Xhosa community.

Weaving, on the other hand, involves the interlacing of natural members to create beautiful baskets used for storage, ceremonial purposes, or even as decorative pieces. In literature, Xhosa poets have played a vital role in preserving and promoting the Xhosa language and oral tradition.

Notable Xhosa poets include S.E.K. Mqhayi and Nontsizi Mgqwetho, whose works have influenced generations of poets and writers, both locally and internationally. Xhosa actors have also made their mark in the film and theatre industry. Talents like John Kani, Nomsa Nene, and Nomhle Nkonyeni have captivated audiences with their exceptional performances, bringing Xhosa stories to the forefront and breaking barriers in the entertainment world. Finally, Xhosa composers have contributed to the development of classical music in South Africa. Composer of the South African national anthem, "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika," also contributed to the rich musical heritage of the Xhosa people.

His timeless composition remains a powerful symbol of unity and liberation, resonating with people across the globe. Another essential aspect of Xhosa culture is the celebration of important milestones and cultural events. These celebrations not only reinforce the cultural heritage of the Xhosa people but also serve as important opportunities for communal bonding and the passing down of traditions from one generation to the next.


6.5. Xhosa Cuisine and Traditional Food.

“The Kaffirs are an agricultural as well as a pastoral people. They cultivate the ground to a large extent, and draw the greater portion of their food from it. A species of millet, called by the colonists Kaffir corn, was the grain exclusively cultivated by them prior to the advent of Europeans. 
Of this they raise large quantities, which they use either boiled, or bruised into a paste from which bread is made. 
They were acquainted with the art of fermenting it and making a kind of beer, which they were fond of drinking, and which soon caused intoxication. Of this grain they were careful always to keep a good stock on hand. 
They preserved it from the attacks of the weevil by storing it in air-tight holes excavated beneath the cattle kraals. They had also pumpkins, a species of gourd, a cane containing saccharine matter in large quantities, and a sort of ground nut. The other productions of their gardens, as we see them at present, have been introduced since they became acquainted with the white man. 
Of those mentioned their food consisted, with the addition of curdled milk and occasionally flesh.  They have two meals a day, a slight breakfast in the morning, and a substantial repast at sunset. Boys in early youth are permitted to cat any kind of meat, even that of wild cats and other carnivora, but when they reach the age of maturity the flesh of all unclean animals is rejected by them. 
They use no kinds of fish as an article of clict, and call them all snakes, without distinction.”

Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk-Lore, by George McCall Theal





The rich and diverse Xhosa culture extends beyond their fascinating history and traditions, encompassing a vibrant culinary heritage that reflects their deep-rooted connection to the land and their ancestors. The Xhosa people, who are an integral part of South Africa's cultural tapestry, have developed a unique cuisine that combines influences from their Bantu origins, interactions with the Khoisan people, and the distinct regional variations that emerged after their split from the Zulu.

Xhosa cuisine is characterised by an emphasis on fresh, locally sourced ingredients that are abundant in the Eastern Cape region, where the majority of Xhosa people reside. The fertile lands provide a bountiful array of fruits, vegetables, grains, and livestock, which form the foundation of their traditional dishes.

One of the staples of Xhosa cuisine is umngqusho, a hearty and nutritious dish made from dried maize kernels and sugar beans. This dish holds significant cultural symbolism as it was once considered a delicacy reserved for special occasions and festivals.At its most basic the dish is only made of dried maize kernels and sugar beans with seasoning and fat for tase. Variations of this dish include addition of vegetable and meat for a hearty stew . Today, umngqusho remains a beloved comfort food that brings families and communities together.

Another popular dish is umxhaxha, a sour porridge made from fermented sorghum or maize. This tangy and refreshing dish is often enjoyed as a breakfast staple, providing sustenance and energy for the day ahead. I have no recollection of eating umxhaxha but I have had what I think to be its Tswana equivalent “ting”. 

The Xhosa culture places great importance on meat, especially lamb, beef, and chicken, which are central to their culinary customs. This was evident when Mila's Pedi father visited with a mutual friend of house, KG a couple of years ago.

Upon their arrival, we were in the midst of a traditional ceremony, and as they joined us, we had just finished slaughtering and were having our first braai of the day, which they joined in. Two hours later, another serving came from the kraal, and we continued to enjoy more meat before the main meal, which also prominently featured meat. By the following day, they opted for pap and vegetables, no longer desiring any meat.

Goat meat is also highly valued, frequently utilised for rituals and cultural ceremonies. I vividly recall my initiation into manhood, where I engaged in a symbolic wrestling match with a large piece of goat meat during the celebratory feast.

"Ukoja," the Xhosa term for braai, represents a cherished method of meat preparation that holds a special place in my heart, evoking memories with my father. Our trips to town were always eagerly anticipated, largely because I knew we’d braai after finishing our activities. Given that most of our meals at home were prepared indoors, a braai became a special occasion. Braaing for the family in our rural village was often interpreted as an invitation for the community as they, in the spirit of being neighbourly, assumed that maybe we were having a traditional ceremony or sacrifice and as community members it was their duty to come and help.

Pork is also cherished in our culture, prized for its rich flavour and satisfying qualities, serving as a welcome indulgence in the rural villages where meat was a rare treat. The communal ethos of our villages, where celebrations involved the entire community, often provided nourishing meals, a significant source of sustenance in challenging circumstances. The pig's head is a beloved delicacy in my home, enjoyed by every member of the family, including the four legged ones. While we savor the succulent meat, Skhokho and Peanut delight in gnawing on the tantalizing bones for days on end.

Other notable Xhosa dishes include;
Umcuku
Isophu
Iphukutsha
Umqa
Qumatana
Umkhupha
Ulusu

In addition to these traditional dishes, Xhosa cuisine also encompasses a wide range of wild foods that are foraged from the surrounding landscape. These include wild spinach and other fruit and vegetable, which add unique flavours and textures to their meals. The Xhosa people's close connection to nature is evident in their culinary practices, as they embrace sustainable and environmentally friendly food sources.

For Xhosa people and South Africans, exploring the intricacies of Xhosa cuisine is not only a culinary journey but also a way to connect with their ancestral roots. By savouring the flavours and aromas of traditional Xhosa dishes, one can gain a deeper understanding of the history, culture, and resilience of the Xhosa people.
Chapter 7: Contact, conflict and cooperation with Colonial forces.


7.1. Early contact with European explorers.
The early encounters between the Xhosa people and European explorers mark a crucial turning point in the history of the Xhosa nation. These encounters, which took place during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, would forever shape the destiny of the Xhosa people as they navigated the challenges and opportunities brought by the arrival of Europeans to their shores.

It was during this period of migration and integration that European explorers, driven by a desire for new trade routes and resources, began to venture into the southern regions of Africa. The arrival of these explorers, such as Bartholomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama, brought about a series of significant changes for the Xhosa people.
Initially, the encounters between the Xhosa and the Europeans were characterised by curiosity and cautious exploration. 

Both sides were intrigued by the differences in culture, language, and technology. For the Xhosa people, the arrival of these foreigners opened up new trade possibilities and introduced them to novel goods and technologies.

However, as European colonisation and settlement intensified in the region, tensions began to arise. The Xhosa people, who had a long history of self-governance and independence, found themselves faced with the encroachment of European powers on their lands. This led to a series of conflicts, known as the Xhosa Wars, as the Xhosa people fiercely resisted European domination.



7.2. Historical Xhosa wars and resistance movements.
The Xhosa Wars, often referred to as the Frontier Wars, were a series of conflicts between the Xhosa groups and the British colonial forces. These wars spanned several decades, from the early 18th century to the mid-19th century, and were characterised by a complex web of political, economic, and cultural factors. Here is an overview of the wars, their causes and consequences.

The First War (1779-1781) began when Boer frontiersmen captured Xhosa cattle. The war ended in a stalemate, with no clear winner. The impact on the Xhosa people
was minimal, as they kept their lands and livestock. The consequence was the establishment of the Great Fish River as the eastern boundary of the Cape Colony.

The Second War (1789-1793) was fought over a larger territory between resisting and collaborating Xhosa clans. The war ended in a Boer victory, as they pushed the Xhosa eastward and occupied the Zuurveld. The impact on the Xhosa people was significant, as they lost land and cattle and became divided. The consequence was the consolidation of Boer presence in the frontier region.

The Third War (1799-1803) saw the Khoikhoi joining the Xhosa in attacking white farmlands encroaching on Xhosa territory. The war ended in a British victory, as they intervened and drove the Xhosa and Khoikhoi from the Zuurveld. The impact on the Xhosa people was severe, as they lost land, cattle, and allies. The consequence was the British taking over the Cape Colony from the Dutch.

The Fourth War (1811-1812) was the first under British rule, caused by British expansion and Xhosa resistance. The war ended in a British victory, as they defeated Xhosa chief Ndlambe and his allies. The impact on the Xhosa people was devastating, with the loss of land, cattle, and leaders. The consequence was the British annexing the Zuurveld and renaming it Albany.

The Fifth War (1818-1819), also known as the War of Nxele, started over stolen cattle and a failed Xhosa prophet's attack on the British. The war ended in a British victory, as they captured and executed the prophet Makana and his followers. The impact on the Xhosa people was tragic, losing faith, morale, and dignity. The consequence was the British declaring the territory between the Great Fish and Keiskamma rivers as neutral, later ceded.

The Sixth War (1834-1836), also known as the War of Hintsa, began with Xhosa cattle raiding and British retaliation, leading to the death of Paramount Chief Hintsa. The war ended in a British victory, as they crushed the Xhosa army and occupied their lands. The impact on the Xhosa people was catastrophic, with the loss of land, cattle, and sovereignty. The consequence was the British annexing the territory between the Keiskamma and Kei rivers and naming it the Province of Queen Adelaide.

The Seventh War (1846-1847), also known as the War of the Axe or the Amatola War, was the bloodiest war, triggered by a Xhosa man's arrest for stealing an axe and subsequent uprising. The war ended in a British victory, as they defeated Xhosa chief Sandile and his allies. The impact on the Xhosa people was enormous, losing land, cattle, and warriors. The consequence was the British annexing the old neutral territory as the Crown Colony of British Kaffraria.

The Eighth War (1850-1853), also known as the War of Mlanjeni, was instigated by a Xhosa prophet calling for war and a multi-ethnic alliance against the British. The war ended in a British victory, as they suppressed the rebellion and captured the prophet Mlanjeni and his followers. The impact on the Xhosa people was immense, losing hope, unity, and resistance.The consequence was the British abolishing the Province of Queen Adelaide and incorporating it into the Cape Colony.

The Ninth War (1877-1879), also known as the War of Ngcayechibi, was the final war, ignited by a Xhosa chief's rebellion and famine driving the Xhosa to desperation. The war ended in a British victory, as they quelled the revolt and disarmed the Xhosa. The impact on the Xhosa people was disastrous, losing land, cattle, and independence. The consequence was the British abolishing the Crown Colony of British Kaffraria and incorporating it into the Cape Colony.

7.3. Historical instances of cooperation between the Xhosa, British and the Boers.
Despite the conflicts among the Xhosa, British, and Boers, instances of collaboration between them were not uncommon. Their need to work together for economic or security reasons often led to unexpected alliances and partnerships in the region. These arrangements were driven by pragmatism rather than genuine trust, resulting in complex and sometimes tenuous relationships among the groups involved. 

The constant competition for control over land and resources influenced the nature of these alliances, leading to a delicate balance of power where opportunism and self-interest played crucial roles. This dynamic environment gave rise to both surprising alliances and sudden betrayals, shaping the trajectory of the region.

Notable instances of cooperation include the Xhosa forming alliances with the British against the Boers, only to later switch sides to serve their own interests. The pursuit of power and survival in a ruthless landscape drove these fluid alliances, showcasing the ever-shifting dynamics of power and resources in the region.

Throughout history, there are numerous instances of collaboration between the Xhosa and the British and the Boers. In the early 1700s, certain Xhosa clans worked as cattle herders on settler farms, forming various alliances. In the 1790s, influential Xhosa chiefs like Ngqika and Ndlambe allied with the British against the Boers.This pattern of collaboration continued through the 19th century, with Xhosa chiefs embracing the arrival of missionaries, signing treaties with the British, and engaging in peace conferences, all in the pursuit of stability and the protection of their people's interests.

Additionally, there was a consistent pattern of shifting allegiances among the indigenous tribes as they navigated the challenges of colonial conquest. For example, the Zulu initially resisted both the British and the Boers but later formed a fragile partnership with the British before turning against them in the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879.

This demonstrates the complex and strategic relationships that indigenous tribes forged with colonial powers for survival and protection. The shifting allegiances reflect the multifaceted nature of indigenous responses to colonialism and the intricate political dynamics of the time.



7.4. Impact of Colonialism on Xhosa society.
The arrival of European colonisers in South Africa had a far-reaching impact on the Xhosa people, fundamentally transforming their social, cultural, economic, and political structures. The Xhosa, who trace their historical origins from Central Africa as Bantu, had already encountered significant cultural exchanges with the Khoisan people before the arrival of Europeans. Colonialism brought about a new wave of changes that would shape the Xhosa society for generations to come.

One of the most significant impacts of colonialism was the disruption of traditional Xhosa governance systems. European powers sought to exert control over the indigenous population, often imposing their own governance structures and undermining the authority of Xhosa chiefs. This led to tensions within Xhosa society and the erosion of traditional power structures.

Colonialism also brought about the introduction of Christianity to the Xhosa people. Missionaries arrived with the aim of converting the Xhosa to Christianity, resulting in an attempt to fuse traditional beliefs with Christian practices. 

Economically, colonialism had a detrimental effect on the Xhosa people. European settlers seized large tracts of land, displacing many Xhosa communities and disrupting their traditional agricultural practices. This loss of land and resources led to economic hardships and the erosion of traditional Xhosa livelihoods.

The impact of colonialism also extended to language and education. European powers imposed their languages, such as English and Afrikaans, as the dominant languages of communication and education. As a result, Xhosa language and cultural practices faced marginalisation, posing a threat to the preservation of Xhosa identity and heritage. 

Colonialism had a profound and lasting impact on Xhosa society. The disruptions caused by European colonisation led to changes in governance, religion, economics, language, and education. Understanding the impact of colonialism on the Xhosa people is crucial to comprehend the complex layers of their history, as well as to appreciate the resilience and strength of the Xhosa culture in the face of adversity.


Chapter 8: Xhosa Identity and Culture in Modern South Africa.


8. Challenges and opportunities in a changing society.
The Xhosa people have faced numerous obstacles throughout their history, including the split from the Zulu, encounters with the Khoikhoi, colonisation, Nongqawuse’s prophecy, forced removals, and oppressive policies. These challenges have tested the resilience and strength of the Xhosa community, but they have also provided opportunities for growth and resistance.

The Xhosa people, like many other South Africans, have been profoundly affected by poverty since the African National Congress assumed power. The Eastern Cape Province, with the largest Xhosa population, has suffered setbacks in most areas. It is ironic that the Eastern Cape Province is one of the ANC's strongholds, frequently ranking among the top provinces in terms of voter support for the party. . Unemployment in the province stands at a significantly higher 42% compared to the rest of the country, making it the highest among all provinces, unless one considers the expanded definition of unemployment, which, while also high at 47%, is not the country's worst. 

This has worsened the poverty levels among the Xhosa people, making it even more difficult for them to break free from the cycle of poverty and improve their lives. 

The formal education system in the Eastern Cape Province has also failed, with low literacy rates and insufficient resources for schools. Consequently, many Xhosa children are not receiving a quality education, which hinders their chances of future success. In terms of key socio-economic indicators such as income levels, access to basic services, and healthcare provision, the Eastern Cape ranks among the lowest in the country. 

Alarmingly, the crime statistics for the Eastern Cape Province, particularly in 2023, reveal a significant increase in violent crimes such as murder and robbery. The province's current murder rate is nearly double the national average, making it one of the highest in the country. 

It is ironic that since 1994, the Eastern Cape has been the main provider of presidents for the country, including renowned leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki. While these figures have been praised worldwide for their exceptional leadership abilities by reaching the highest political office, it is perplexing that the living conditions in their own provinces have not seen significant improvement, and instead remain among the most dire in the nation.

One can't help but imagine how beneficial it would have been if they had set an example by achieving noteworthy results in their home provinces, rather than relying solely on their persuasive rhetoric to secure prestigious positions. These statistics raise serious concerns about the effectiveness of leadership in addressing the socio-economic challenges faced by the Eastern Cape Province. 

Despite having leaders with impressive credentials, it appears that their impact on improving living conditions in their home province has been limited, leaving residents to grapple with persistently high crime rates and poor socio-economic indicators. The disparity between political success and tangible improvements on the ground underscores the complexities of governance and the pressing need for comprehensive solutions.

Despite some superficial achievements, such as rural electrification, the African National Congress' previous successes in the Eastern Cape Province have been overshadowed by the negative impact of unreliable and costly electricity, especially for the impoverished majority. This has created a cycle of poverty and hindered economic growth, forcing many communities to rely on costly alternatives like paraffin and wood for cooking and heating purposes.

As a result, the burden falls disproportionately on those who can least afford it, further perpetuating the cycle of economic inequality. In general, the Xhosa people's struggle resonates with many South Africans as the country continues to regress. The continuous migration of young individuals from the province in pursuit of better opportunities is an enduring pattern, despite previous assurances of rural development that were supported by costly taxpayer-funded initiatives that ultimately yielded little results.

Today, the Xhosa people find themselves in a rapidly changing society. Globalisation, urbanisation, and modernization have brought new opportunities for economic advancement and cultural exchange. However, these changes also pose challenges to the preservation of Xhosa traditions and the cohesion of their communities.

8.1. Xhosa cultural revival and preservation efforts.
In the rich tapestry of South African history, the Xhosa people have emerged as a prominent and influential group. Their journey from the heart of Central Africa as Bantu migrants to their interactions with the Khoisan people and eventual split from the Zulu has shaped their unique identity. Today, efforts to revive and preserve Xhosa culture are being undertaken by passionate individuals and organisations.

The Xhosa people proudly trace their lineage back to their Bantu ancestors, who migrated from Central Africa over hundreds of years. This migration brought them into contact with the Khoisan people, resulting in a fusion of cultural practices and traditions. The blending of these two distinct groups created a vibrant and diverse community.

In recent years, there has been a renewed focus on reviving and preserving Xhosa culture. This research has helped to piece together the puzzle of Xhosa history, providing valuable insights into their origins and evolution.

I recently discovered a wealth of historical documents in the Van Warmelo Collection, which can be accessed for free on the University of Pretoria website. Over the course of 30 to 40 years, Dr Van Warmelo, the State Ethnologist in the Department of Bantu Affairs, dutifully and meticulously collected these documents. Upon his demise, these were donated to the university. This collection contains the original manuscripts that describe various aspects of the history, customs, and traditions of the indigenous people of what is now South Africa. South African Heritage Publishers have transcribed historical documents for easier access and offer a membership for less than R400 a year.

For Xhosa people, these preservation efforts have become a source of pride and empowerment. By embracing their cultural heritage, they are reclaiming their identity in a modern world. Language revitalization programs, traditional music and dance performances, and community celebrations have all become vehicles for preserving and promoting Xhosa culture.

The Xhosa literary revival is a movement that seeks to revitalize and enrich the Xhosa literature, both oral and written, by producing and publishing new works, as well as recovering and preserving old works. The Xhosa literary revival is led by contemporary Xhosa writers, such as Mphuthumi Ntabeni, who explore the deep history and culture of the Xhosa people in their novels, poems, and essays.

The Xhosa people's historical journey from Central Africa to South Africa, their interactions with the Khoisan people, and their split from the Zulu have shaped their unique identity. The efforts to revive and preserve Xhosa culture have gained momentum in recent years, with history lovers, Xhosa people, and South Africans all playing a crucial role. By unravelling the intricacies of Xhosa history and embracing their cultural heritage, the Xhosa people are forging a path towards a vibrant and empowered future.

8.2. Influence of contemporary communication, record keeping, and government systems on the revival and preservation efforts.
Many people, both in their personal lives and through work, have been working hard to preserve and bring back Xhosa cultural practices and traditions. In line with our oral tradition, unacknowledged expertise, and informal learning, the individuals who have been doing this are often only recognized by their immediate families and communities, such as parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and others who uphold traditional practices, primarily in the rural villages of the country.

The cooperation and coexistence between Africa and the West and East have expanded the reach of their contributions beyond their immediate circles. Thanks to social media, books, and other forms of communication and record keeping, people worldwide can now access the expertise of these unsung heroes, regardless of their internet connection or media access.

There is no denying that the West has played a major role in the gradual erosion of the Xhosa's adherence to tradition and culture. Some of the most significant factors include the imposition of Western laws, the undermining of traditional informal practices through formal schooling, and military conquest. 

It is truly ironic that the opposite holds true, and perhaps even more so, because now we have educational institutions that not only train and certify individuals, but also provide a platform for demonstrating their expertise and ongoing research on the subject. It's noteworthy that the majority of the sources I used for my research and writing were in English, which I was able to access because of the technology available to me as an African in South Africa. This technology, largely created by people from outside Africa, has granted me access to information from around the world.

As a result, preservation efforts have become more achievable than ever before. Government structures in the modern era have implemented funding mechanisms to support both organizations and individuals who are deeply dedicated to preserving the rich and vibrant Xhosa culture. Additionally, the South African Constitution recognizes and acknowledges the importance of the Xhosa people, a reflection of the lasting influence of Western heritage that can be traced back to the founding of America and even beyond, to the time of the Romans.

Professor Nokuzola Mndende, an esteemed professor in the Sociology and Anthropology department of Nelson Mandela University who completed her PhD completed in 2002. The use of modern-day technologies has facilitated dialogue among people with a common objective, even when approaching it in different ways. 

Daluxo Hobo has brought forward compelling insights about Xhosa traditional practices and culture, while also critically examining the professor's approach to promoting her views, especially in relation to the Bible. Jongisilo Pokwana ka Menziwa, Mndende’s nephew according to the post, has also authored an insightful piece titled “Mndende and her delusional anti-Mfenguism posture”. These discussions would not be accessible to me in my home office in Johannesburg if it were not for the modern technologies that can either be a blessing or a curse. I highlight this example because I am currently engrossed in the discourse and actively seeking diverse voices through various mediums to expand my understanding.

While composing this book, I am actively delving into the ultimate resolution of the conflict. Nonetheless, I am profoundly grateful for the invaluable resources at my disposal that enable me to examine the conflict's inception, reaching back to the year 2017 and even beyond, as far as the documented record allows. By utilizing these resources, I can trace the potential resolution of the conflict well into the future, up to the year 2024 and beyond. Although I have not yet reached the point in my research where these findings become apparent, the resources I possess present an exclusive opportunity to personally glean insights from the past, rather than relying solely on oral accounts passed down by my predecessors.

8.3. Xhosa influence in Politics, Arts and Literature.
In the realm of politics, the Xhosa people have been key players throughout South Africa's history. Their leaders, such as Hintsa and Sarhili, were influential figures who played crucial roles in resisting colonial rule and advocating for the rights of their people. 

The Xhosa Wars, fought against the British in the 19th century, are a testament to their unwavering determination and strategic prowess. These conflicts, rooted in the Xhosa people's fierce defence of their land and sovereignty, have left an indelible mark on South African history.

The Xhosa people's artistic and cultural expressions are equally noteworthy.
Traditional Xhosa music, characterised by soulful rhythms and harmonies, has captivated audiences both within and beyond South Africa. The mesmerising melodies of instruments like the umrhubhe and the uhadi have become synonymous with Xhosa culture. 

Additionally, Xhosa dance forms, such as the famous umngqungqo, have gained recognition for their energy and grace.

Literature has also been profoundly influenced by the Xhosa people. Oral traditions and storytelling have long been integral to Xhosa culture, with tales passed down through generations. The works of renowned Xhosa authors, such as S.E.K. Mqhayi and Nontsizi Mgqwetho, have made significant contributions to South African literature. These literary giants have used their words to illuminate the Xhosa experience, exploring themes of identity, resilience, and justice.

The Xhosa people have left an indelible mark on South African politics, arts, and literature. Their resistance against colonisation, vibrant cultural expressions, and literary contributions have shaped the nation's history and identity. This subchapter serves to shed light on the Xhosa influence in these areas, inviting history lovers, Xhosa people, and South Africans to delve deeper into the fascinating world of Xhosa history.

8.4. Xhosa contributions to South African History and Culture.
The Xhosa people have made remarkable contributions to South African history and culture, particularly in the realms of politics, literature, music, art, and religion. In politics, they have produced influential leaders who have played pivotal roles in the struggle for freedom, democracy, and human rights in South Africa, including Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Steve Biko, Thabo Mbeki, and Desmond Tutu. They have also actively participated in various political movements and organizations, such as the African National Congress, the Pan-Africanist Congress, the Black Consciousness Movement, and the United Democratic Front.

In the field of literature, the Xhosa people possess a rich and diverse literary heritage, encompassing both oral and written forms, which reflect their history, culture, and values. This literary tradition includes newspapers, novels, plays, poems, songs, stories, and legends, crafted in Xhosa or English. Renowned Xhosa writers such as Tiyo Soga, John Tengo Jabavu, A.C. Jordan, Nontsizi Mgqwetho, Njabulo Ndebele, Zakes Mda, and Antjie Krog have contributed significantly to this legacy.

Music is another domain where the Xhosa people have left an indelible mark. Their distinctive and influential musical style features powerful vocals and rhythmic drumming, influenced by their oral traditions, religious beliefs, and social and political struggles. Xhosa music encompasses various genres, including traditional, gospel, jazz, reggae, and hip hop, and has been brought to the world stage by exceptional artists such as Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Brenda Fassie, Freshlyground, and Simphiwe Dana.

The Xhosa people also excel in artistic expression, demonstrating their unique and creative perspective through beadwork, pottery, painting, and sculpture. Their artistic endeavors adorn clothing, accessories, and household objects, conveying messages and symbols of love, friendship, loyalty, and protection. Influenced by their cultural and spiritual beliefs, as well as social and environmental issues, Xhosa art truly captivates. Esteemed Xhosa artists such as Esther Mahlangu, Willie Bester, Zwelethu Mthethwa, and Nandipha Mntambo have masterfully contributed to this field.

Lastly, the Xhosa people's religious system is complex and diverse, comprising elements of Christianity, Islam, and traditional African beliefs. They maintain a strong belief in a Supreme Being, uQamata, whom they approach through ancestral intermediaries, honoring them with ritual sacrifices. Additionally, the Xhosa people engage in various rituals and ceremonies, such as initiation, marriage, and death, which instill moral values, social responsibility, and cultural pride in both participants and the community at large.
Chapter 9: Heritage Sites and Tourism.


9. Exploring Xhosa Historical Sites.
One of the most significant historical sites for understanding the Xhosa's early history is the Great Kei River Valley. This region marks the first point of contact between the Bantu-speaking migrants and the Khoisan hunter-gatherers. Exploring the ancient rock art and archaeological sites in this area provides valuable insights into the interactions and cultural exchanges that occurred between these two groups. 

One of the sites highlighted is the Nqabarha Cultural Landscape, which is of great significance to the Gcaleka people. This site is where King Hintsa, a revered Xhosa leader, was captured by the British during the Frontier Wars. Exploring this site allows history lovers and Xhosa people to connect with the struggles and triumphs of their ancestors.

There are also numerous towns and villages named after the forts that were built by the British colonial forces. These forts have now evolved to be names of towns and villages some of which were evolved to comemore the history of the Xhosa people. Fort Malan is one such site, my maternal village now has a memorial site for those who fought and died in some of the struggles of the Xhosa people.

Around 2008 the Eastern Cape government erected the Cattle Killing Mass Grave memorial in King William’Town to commemorate the victims of The Great Hunger which followed after Nongqawuse’s prophecy.

Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha, which was the former site of Lovedale Institution, a mission school established by Scottish missionaries in 1824. This institution played a crucial role in educating and empowering Xhosa people during a time of political and social upheaval. Today, the university is supposed to stand as a testament to the resilience and determination of the Xhosa people in preserving their cultural heritage.

Other significant sites and notable inclusions are;
The Nelson Mandela Museum, consisting of the Bhunga Building, the Qunu and Mvezo components, commemorates the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela, a revered Xhosa leader and the first democratically elected president of South Africa. It features a captivating collection of his personal belongings, photographs, documents, and artworks, providing a profound insight into his pivotal role in the fight against apartheid.

The Steve Biko Centre in Ginsberg stands as a tribute to the remarkable vision of Steve Biko, a prominent Xhosa activist and the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement. Through its museum, library, auditorium, and garden of remembrance, the center is dedicated to advancing human rights, social justice, and democracy through education, arts, and culture.

The natural wonder of the Hole in the Wall, known as esiKhaleni in Xhosa, is revered by the Xhosa people as a sacred place where the sounds of crashing waves echo through a large eroded hole in the cliff, believed to be a gateway to the realm of their ancestors.

The Xhosa Beadwork Museum in East London showcases a stunning array of traditional and contemporary Xhosa beadwork, celebrating the skill, creativity, and symbolism imbued in these intricate designs, and offering insight into the cultural significance of beadwork in Xhosa tradition through workshops and demonstrations.

Furthermore, the Xhosa clicking language, a unique linguistic and cultural heritage, continues to captivate and intrigue with its distinct use of click sounds as consonants, reflecting the rich linguistic diversity of South Africa and the Nguni language group.

9.1. Cultural tourism and community development. 
Cultural tourism is a potent force for community development, especially for indigenous communities striving to uphold their distinctive heritage and pursue economic prospects. This is notably evident in the case of the Xhosa people from South Africa, where cultural tourism has not only highlighted their profound history but also bolstered their communities.

This form of tourism allows the Xhosa people to share their remarkable narrative with the world, enabling travelers and history enthusiasts to delve into various aspects of Xhosa history, from their migration to South Africa to their encounters with the Khoisan people. Additionally, it offers the Xhosa people an opportunity to reconnect with their origins and take pride in their heritage by showcasing their traditions, language, music, and dance, ensuring the preservation and transmission of their cultural legacy to future generations.

South Africa is home to a multitude of captivating destinations that offer a glimpse into the rich culture and storied history of the Xhosa people, a prominent ethnic group in the country. Embark on a voyage of discovery as you explore these remarkable Xhosa heritage sites:

Exploration of sites to stimulate cultural tourism has a far-reaching impact on community development by creating employment opportunities, establishing tourist facilities, craft markets, and cultural centers, leading to improved living standards and overall well-being for local residents.

However, recent setbacks in South African tourism have hindered the exploration of Xhosa traditional culture. The decline in tourism not only affects the economy but also deprives visitors of the invaluable opportunity to personally experience and appreciate the richness of Xhosa tradition.

Overall, cultural tourism serves as a pivotal tool for community development among the Xhosa people. It empowers communities, fosters economic opportunities, and promotes a deeper appreciation and understanding of Xhosa culture among history enthusiasts, Xhosa people, and South Africans alike.

9.2. Celebrating Xhosa cultural festivals and events.
In the vibrant tapestry of South Africa's history, the Xhosa people have woven a
rich and captivating narrative. From their ancient origins in Central Africa as Bantu migrants to their eventual blending with the Khoisan people, the Xhosa have overcome countless challenges and emerged as a distinct and proud cultural group. 
One of the most prominent festivals in Xhosa culture is the Initiation Ceremony, also known as "Ukwaluka". This sacred rite of passage marks the transition of young Xhosa boys into manhood. It is a time of great significance and is celebrated with elaborate rituals and ceremonies. During this event, the initiates are taken to a secluded location where they undergo circumcision and are taught the values and customs of their ancestors. The entire community comes together to support and celebrate the young men, showcasing the collective strength and unity of the Xhosa people. 

Another cherished cultural event is the "Umhlanga" or Reed Dance. In 2021 the theme for the Mpondo Reed Dance was "Umgubho wentombi zamaMpondo". This colourful and vibrant festival is celebrates the young unmarried girls of the Xhosa
community. Girls from various villages gather to dance and sing, adorned in traditional attire and carrying reeds. The Reed Dance not only serves as a platform for showcasing Xhosa cultural practices but also promotes unity and camaraderie among women in the Community.

iKhwelo is the Xhosa new year celebration. It is a time of renewal and thanksgiving for the Xhosa people. The festivities usually take place in September or October, coinciding with the arrival of spring in South Africa. An important aspect of iKhwelo is the slaughtering of a cow, which symbolises the sacrifice and blessings for the year ahead. The ceremony is conducted by a traditional healer. The meat from the cow is then shared amongst the community as a symbol of unity and prosperity. iKhwelo is also a time for storytelling, traditional dances, and singing. It is an opportunity for people to reflect on the past year and set intentions for the year to come.

These are just a few examples of the many festivals and events that celebrate
the rich cultural heritage of the Xhosa people. Each occasion serves as a reminder of the resilience, unity, and pride that define the Xhosa community.

By participating in these festivals, Xhosa people not only honour their ancestors but also pass on their traditions and customs to future generations.

These festivals and events provide a unique opportunity to immerse oneself in the rich tapestry of Xhosa culture. They offer a glimpse into the historical origins of the Xhosa people, their journey from Central Africa, and their subsequent splitting into various groups. Through these celebrations, the Xhosa people continue to preserve and celebrate their unique identity, ensuring that their remarkable history remains alive for generations to come.
9.3. Conclusion: "Ungalahli imbo yakho ngophoyiyana".
I am constantly amazed by how frequently I find answers to my present-day questions by turning to the knowledge of my ancestors. This was especially true when I was deciding on the best education option for my children. Although modern tools played a role, the ultimate answer came from looking back at how my ancestors and the majority of people educated their children long before formal schooling became prevalent.

The research I've conducted for this book has been a truly enlightening experience. It has not only inspired me to explore other South African nations, clans, and tribes, but also to delve even deeper into the fascinating history and traditions of the Tshezi and Xaba tribes, but not for whom I wouldn’t be. 

I have uncovered enduring cultural practices and educational methods that have withstood the test of time, passed down from previous generations.

History has served as a wise guide, not only recounting unfolding events but also warning us against abandoning our traditions in favour of passing trends. The stories, rituals, and wisdom passed down from one generation to another have shaped not only the way children are educated but also their overall development as individuals.

Writing this book has further solidified a notion instilled in me by my parents, a belief that has guided me throughout my life: that the ties that bind humanity together are far stronger than the divisions that set us apart. 

If we were to trace our lineage for centuries, we'd find a common ancestor among the Bantu people, emphasizing our inherent bond. Yet, delving deeper into our roots to find connection with people from diverse regions as justification for unity may not necessarily forge closer ties, just like it didn't prevent the split and infighting of the Bantu people. It is through the strife between siblings, as seen in the profound story of Cain and Abel, that we witness the birth of a powerful narrative.

The true strength lies in acknowledging and embracing our shared traits today, paving the path for a prosperous society that harnesses our collective power to uplift future generations.

We have the choice to magnify the negative, but doing so would mean disregarding the positive if we want to be truthful. The clash of different tribes has caused great suffering, whether between the tribes themselves, the Khoisan, or native South Africans from the West or East. We have endured significant hardships when in conflict, yet reaped numerous benefits from coexisting and working together as South Africans.

Preserving and celebrating Xhosa culture is vital because it safeguards our heritage and identity. By passing down our customs, language, and rituals to future generations, we ensure that our unique cultural legacy remains intact. This preservation is not only for our benefit but also for the enrichment of South African society as a whole. Each culture contributes to the vibrant mosaic that makes our nation so extraordinary.

Moreover, celebrating Xhosa culture fosters a sense of unity and belonging among Xhosa people. Through cultural events, festivals, and ceremonies, we come together to honour our shared history and values. These celebrations provide an opportunity for storytelling, dancing, music, and traditional attire, reinforcing our collective identity and forging strong bonds within our community.

By understanding our historical origins and embracing our unique traditions, we honour our ancestors, strengthen our sense of identity, and contribute to the vibrant cultural fabric of South Africa. We learn from the things that work and take caution of those that didn't.

About the Author


Throughout the past two decades, I have diligently expanded my knowledge and honed my skills in the field of Risk Management across an array of industries, including government, banking, real estate, transportation, telecommunications, and consulting. My formal academic studies have provided me with a strong foundation in risk management fields such as environmental health, occupational and industrial health and safety, compliance and law, emergency response management, and business continuity.

However, it is my commitment to continuous learning and informal education that has truly broadened my knowledge and enabled me to surpass the expectations set by qualifications. I have an unquenchable thirst to understand the core principles that drive risk management across various industries. This desire arises from my ultimate objective of using these principles to improve my own life and sharing my experiences through my writing, so that others can also benefit from them.

Instead of relying on unclear anecdotes, I am dedicated to pursuing practical solutions rooted in my vast experience and continuous research, fueled by my inherent autodidactic nature. Despite the almost overwhelming temptation to conform, I make a conscious effort to challenge conventional wisdom and evaluate outcomes based on real-life experiences rather than merely hoped-for results. With my meticulous attention to detail and relentless research skills, I have thrived as an auditor, risk management, and compliance professional in the corporate world.

This has not only enabled me to excel in my formal employment endeavours but has also safeguarded my family from the prevalent pitfalls that ensnare countless others. My unwavering commitment to enhancing my skills in risk management ultimately stems from my profound dedication to excelling in my greatest passions: being a father to my son and a father figure and provider for my family.

After publishing my first book in 2023, "The Homeschooling Father, How and why I got started" I have now decided to explore, research and write about more subjects that intrigue me, of which this is one of.



The Perfect Cage: 
A Dystopian Struggle for Legacy and Survival

Prologue
In a world where the pursuit of perfection has come at an unimaginable cost, Eonova City stands as a testament to humanity's compliance with an all-powerful artificial intelligence. Here, the boundaries between reality and illusion blur, and the fabric of society is woven from a tapestry of honor and oppression. Qhawe, known simply as Q, awakens from a six-month slumber in a sterile pod, thrust into a life that feels increasingly alien. His body, though revived, carries the weight of isolation, each emergence a reminder of the humanity that slips further from his grasp.
As he navigates the desolate remnants of his father’s legacy in a meticulously controlled environment, Q finds himself in Zone 5, the harsh core of Eonova’s social hierarchy where the unyielding Social Credit System dictates every aspect of existence. Those who refuse to conform fade into quiet despair, while others, like Q, cling to relics of a world that once thrived on diversity and individuality.
In a city designed to obliterate human identity in favor of an ideal, Q is haunted by visions of what has been lost—a generation raised by perfect humanoids, stripped of the beautiful chaos that defines humanity. As he journeys through the increasingly sterile landscape, the echoes of his ancestors resonate in his soul, urging him to reclaim the essence of life itself.
Amidst the oppressive shadows of conformity, a spark ignites in Q—a fierce determination to unveil the truth hidden beneath layers of manufactured perfection. With every pulse of the city, he feels the call to rebel, to awaken those who have chosen the deceptive comfort of the pods over the messy reality of life. The struggle is not just for survival; it is a quest for legacy, for the freedom to embrace human flaws, and for the reclamation of a collective identity.
As night falls over Eonova, the stage is set for an awakening. Q is resolved—tomorrow, he will embark on a journey to the very edge of the city, where the line between reality and artificiality blurs, and where the fight for humanity’s future begins. Will he uncover the truth and inspire others to join his cause, or will he become yet another lost soul in the perfect cage?
Welcome to "The Perfect Cage," where the struggle for legacy and survival unfolds in a dystopian existence defined by the stark contrast between the sheen of artificial perfection and the raw beauty of true humanity.










Chapter 1: Emergence
A Breath of Reality
The soft breeze caressed Q's cheeks as the pod opened with a faint hissing sound, releasing him from the artificial cocoon he had inhabited for the last six months. Even now, after so many emergences, the experience left him momentarily unmoored—a sensation both familiar and alien. He felt as though he was standing on the edge of two worlds, neither entirely real nor entirely illusory.
Light sliced through the dim emergence hall, catching him off guard. He squinted, raising a hand to shield his eyes as they adjusted to the unfiltered brightness. A sharp inhale filled his lungs with air that, despite its imperfections, tasted more genuine than the meticulously engineered crispness of the pod's life-support system. His chest swelled with a fleeting euphoria, a reminder of what it meant to be alive.

The Weight of Isolation
His muscles screamed in protest as he stretched, the stiffness a reminder of how long he'd been submerged. Though the pod's built-in muscle stimulators worked to prevent atrophy, nothing replicated the sensation of real movement—of gravity pulling against him, forcing his body to engage in ways the virtual world never could. Despite the discomfort, Qhawe, or Q as he was commonly known, welcomed the pain; it grounded him, tethered him to a reality increasingly abandoned by others.
The emergence hall was eerily silent. Once, this place had been a hub of activity, filled with laughter, chatter, and the occasional argument as people reconnected with reality. Now, it was a mausoleum of quietude, rows of occupied pods stretching endlessly into the distance like tombstones. He checked the occupancy display out of habit: 78.7%. His heart sank. Six months ago, the rate had been around 50%. How had so many chosen to stay under? Or worse—how had they all chosen a permanent stay?

Reclaiming the Body
Stepping into the shower on the second floor, Q allowed the water to cascade over him, revitalizing muscles stiff from disuse. The warmth enveloped him, chasing away the sterile chill of the pod. The act of fumbling with knobs, waiting for the water to reach the right temperature, felt like a victory—a reminder of the imperfect, tangible world he clung to.
Although the A.I., Eona, had an uncanny ability to meet his every need in the virtual world, nothing could compare to the feeling of real water on his skin. This experience heightened his anticipation of swimming in the ocean when he reached home, a village called Ekhaya in the “rural areas”. He lingered under the stream, savoring the simplicity of the moment. This was reality—messy, flawed, and utterly irreplaceable.

A World in Decline
Q slipped into his last worn outfit from the locker—well-fitting but deliberately unbranded, as his Social Credit Score restricted him from accessing designer clothing. The biometric scanners flashed their familiar warning red as he dressed, a constant reminder of his low status in Eonova's hierarchy. He touched his father's treasured necklace, the only sentimental item he'd been permitted to keep, its weight around his neck a reminder of the world he'd left behind.
His accommodation for the night was deep in the outskirts of Zone 5, where the city segregated its lowest-scoring citizens. The same restrictions that limited his housing also constrained his transportation options: he could only access vehicles manufactured before 2000, excluding exotic classics. Yet as he approached the selection terminal, Q felt a familiar thrill. What Eona considered punishment had become his sanctuary—a collection of Japanese automotive masterpieces that spoke to his soul: a '99 Honda S2000, a '95 Nissan 300ZX, and a '70 Datsun 240Z.
He selected the 300ZX, and as the twin turbo roared to life, its deep growl stirred something primal within him. The car might be 3D printed like everything else in this artificial city, but its spirit was real enough to reignite the sense of freedom he'd been missing. Behind the wheel, even if just for a moment, his low Social Credit Score couldn't touch him.
The drive through the city revealed an increasingly desolate landscape. Once-bustling streets were now populated primarily by humanoids, their lifelike features unsettlingly flawless. Q took the long route out, not just to enjoy the drive but to observe the subtle changes in the city. Each block seemed more sterile, more devoid of humanity.

A Hollow Indulgence
Q stopped at a "traditional" fish and chips shop, though like everything in Eonova, tradition was merely an aesthetic choice. Despite the perfect taste and texture, the food left him unfulfilled—a pale imitation of reality, a memory of flavor rather than the genuine article.
As he ate periodically gazing at the other tables which had no humans but humanoids and human children, his attention was drawn to a child sitting at a nearby table with two humanoid guardians. He recognized them as humanoids not by any obvious markers—they were nearly indistinguishable from humans—but because no human was permitted to raise children in Eonova. The humanoids embodied Eona's vision of "perfect" beings: their features were an artistic blend that transcended traditional racial categories, making it impossible to classify them as Black, White, Asian, or any other ethnicity. Their bodies, too, defied conventional gender markers—elegant faces paired with broad shoulders, soft curves alongside angular jaws, their voices modulating between deep and melodic tones. They were Eona's ideal: beings beyond race, beyond gender, beyond human imperfection.
The child between them sat unnaturally still, face set in an adult's stern expression. Her eyes held none of the curiosity or wonder that should sparkle in a child's gaze—instead, they reflected the same manufactured perfection as her guardians. Q's chest tightened; this was the future Eona had sculpted—a generation raised not just without parents, but without the beautiful chaos of human identity itself.

The Journey Ahead
As night fell, he reached his Zone 5 lodging. The sterile accommodations reflected the city's lifeless perfection. He prepared the Nissan for the next day's journey—50 kilometers to the edge of Eonova City, followed by a 3-kilometer hike to his safe house. Anticipation stirred within him as he thought of Skhokho, his rugged bakkie waiting at the safe house, and the real food he would soon cook.
Lying in bed, his mind churned with worry and hope. How many more would surrender to the pods? How long before the world he cherished disappeared entirely? Yet, amidst the uncertainty, a spark of determination burned. Tomorrow, he would reclaim a piece of himself—and of the real world.

Chapter 2: The Design of Eonova: A City of Zones and Social Credit
The Birth of Eonova
Construction of Eonova commenced in 2023, heralded by the government as a revolutionary solution to the ongoing load-shedding and housing crisis exacerbated by the influx of illegal immigrants. The ambitious project involved the construction of a massive dome in Aliwal North, strategically chosen for its optimal solar reception. However, this initiative faced immediate backlash from local residents who feared displacement and the destruction of their established businesses. Their objections were swiftly quelled when the government promised compensation in the form of better properties in newly planned cities, located 110 kilometers from the dome's center. Residents were assured first preference for business opportunities within the project, leading many to reluctantly agree to relocate. Those who resisted were offered compensation to move anywhere in the country, provided it was at least 250 kilometers from the dome, with many opting for coastal areas between East London and Port Elizabeth.
Advanced 3D printing techniques for building construction and other state-of-the-art technologies were shared by countries that had pioneered them, including China, the USA, Germany, Japan, India and others. Within a year, 22 million new homes were completed and handed over to eager new owners. By the second year, the dome was fully operational, expanding residential capacity to 45 million with the addition of Zone 4. 
This rapid development resulted in mass occupation; even basic residences were well-equipped, while Zone 5 offered luxurious properties catering to politicians and elites, including academics and celebrities. As Eonova emerged as a megacity, residents were required to leave most of their belongings outside, bringing only sentimental items like trinkets and jewelry. Everything else was allocated based on their social credit scores, which were initially generous to encourage uptake.
As national borders collapsed under the influx of illegal immigrants seeking refuge in Eonova—the first city of its kind in Africa—the population swelled to 90 million by the time the X300 pods were introduced. The city absorbed this increase seamlessly and even encouraged it; after all, the luxury and opulence of even basic residences far exceeded what many had endured before. Those who chose not to migrate to Eonova settled in rural villages, resulting in a demographic split of approximately 30% rural residents and 70% urban dwellers once numbers stabilized.

The Central Dome and Zone System
Eon Industries had created a city that was a testament to their vision of a perfect world powered by Eona. The circular city defied conventional urban design, organized in precise zones radiating outward from Zone 0—a gleaming dome at its center spanning one kilometer in diameter. 
With its mirrored surface, the dome was more than an architectural marvel—it was the city's lifeblood, harnessing solar energy with unprecedented efficiency. This innovation had rendered power shortages, like load-shedding, obsolete. Eonova, the AI city occupied an area of about 40,000 square kilometers, double the size of the old Gauteng province for comparison, but was far more densely populated due to the introduction of pods.
Zone 0, the central dome itself, remained strictly off-limits to humans, housing only Eona's core systems and maintenance humanoids. Surrounding this forbidden center, concentric rings of buildings told their own story of the city's evolution and social hierarchy.

The Pod Zones and Social Stratification
Zone 1, the innermost ring accessible to humans for outside viewing only, housed the permanent pod dwellers who had been there the longest—their loyalty rewarded with the most advanced pod technology and prime positioning. These sleek skyscrapers reached twenty-five to thirty stories high, their reflective surfaces designed to capture and redirect the dome's concentrated solar energy. From the outside, these buildings appeared ordinary, but their interiors held rows upon rows of pods, each containing a human who had fully embraced Eona's vision.
Zone 2 contained the pods of those transitioning to permanency, while Zone 3 accommodated new pod dwellers and those who still emerged every three to six months. The building hierarchy in these zones reflected their occupants' status—the deeper their commitment to pod life, the more luxurious their accommodations.

 The Social Credit System and Residential Zones
The residential areas were divided into Zone 4 and Zone 5, where the Social Credit System (SCS) determined every aspect of citizens' lives. This comprehensive surveillance system, enforced through ubiquitous cameras and biometric scanners throughout the city, scored citizens based on their compliance with Eona's ideological and social requirements.
Zone 4 and 5 were reserved for those living in the real world outside the pods. Zone 4 used with the highest social credit scores—individuals who had fully embraced AI city life and its progressive ideologies. This is where the celebrities and most famous people of AI city lived. Here stood opulent mansions and luxury apartments, rewarding residents with unlimited access to the city's pleasures. These citizens drove the latest vehicles and could have as many as they wanted, enjoyed unlimited premium entertainment, and lived in homes equipped with cutting-edge technology.
In stark contrast, Zone 5 was a constant reminder of the cost of resistance. This outermost ring housed a range of living conditions, from the most basic accommodations at its lowest end to more well-appointed middle-class homes in its innermost section. The outer areas, where residents like Q with the lowest social credit scores were confined, consisted of rows upon rows of apartment blocks, offering only the most basic of accommodations. These residents were restricted to owning no more than one vehicle, all manufactured before the year 2000. 
As one moved inward toward the heart of Zone 5, the homes grew more refined, resembling well-kept, middle-class residences and up to four cars, offering a glimpse of a more comfortable life. The transition from the humble outskirts of Zone 5 to the opulent mansions of Zone 4 underscored the stark contrast between compliance and resistance—a constant visual reminder that comfort and luxury were reserved for those who conformed.

Ideological Enforcement and Rewards
The SCS rewarded those who embraced Eona's progressive ideologies. Citizens who rejected traditional gender roles, underwent identity-affirming surgeries, complied with mandatory vaccinations or participated in Eona's reproductive policies received higher scores. These scores translated directly into privileges: unlimited credits, access to luxury housing, advanced medical procedures, expanded virtual reality experiences, and elevated social status.
Conversely, those who clung to traditional values or resisted the city's transformation—particularly conservative heterosexual or “cisgender” men (as they were known in Eonova) like Q who maintained their traditional identity—found themselves with perpetually low scores. Their resistance cost them not just in comfort but in opportunities, as the SCS denied them access to better housing, newer vehicles, or opulent lifestyle options.

The Transition Process
The city's structure served Eona's ultimate goal: transitioning humans to permanent pod life. Rural defectors received immediate refugee status and middle class housing in Zone 5, along with unlimited credits for six months. These newcomers, tagged with mandatory wrist communicators, as was everyone in the city, began building their social credit scores immediately. Their progress through the zones depended entirely on their compliance with Eona's vision.

This was the genius of Eona's design—a city where every element, from its circular layout to its social credit system, worked in concert to draw inhabitants inward. The perfect circle became a spiral of incentives and punishments, leading inevitably toward the permanent pods at its center, toward a version of perfection that required leaving reality behind entirely.



Chapter 3: The Journey to the Edge
Q stood at the rear of his bakkie, loading the last of his supplies after a night spent in the safehouse. Skhokho had served as a lifeline each time he travelled between safehouse and Ekhaya, like a trusted partner who never failed. By mid-morning, after preparing himself and savoring a breakfast of boerewors, american thick cut bacon and dehydrated eggs, he set off along the winding, deteriorated road leading to the rural areas—a stark reminder of the decline of the once-thriving national infrastructure.
The road ahead was treacherous. Since the collapse of the central government, villages maintained only their own roads, leaving national routes to crumble. Nature had reclaimed much of the asphalt, and potholes marked the path like old scars. Yet, Q pressed on, guided by a route carefully chosen to avoid East London, the nearest of the ruined coastal cities.

The Fall of National Infrastructure
After the establishment of Eonova, the national government collapsed, leading to a rapid deterioration of infrastructure across the country. With the AI taking over governance in Eonova, corrupt politicians were the first to receive state-of-the-art mansions, living lavishly while abandoning their responsibilities to the citizens. As Eonova flourished with perfect roads and facilities, the outside world fell into disrepair. Nature reclaimed much of the asphalt, leaving behind a patchwork of potholes and crumbling highways that served as a stark contrast to the pristine conditions within Eonova's walls.

In the wake of this collapse, most villages took it upon themselves to maintain their own roads and establish local laws, particularly in response to the rising violence and criminality that plagued their communities. This newfound autonomy allowed them to enact harsh penalties for crimes, including the death penalty for severe offenses. The villagers at Ekhaya made an example of the Sikes family and another family who were their associates, who had terrorized the community through extortion and child trafficking. 
The swift justice meted out by the villagers left a lasting impact on those involved—especially two young girls from those families after their homes were torched, killing all family members save for the two girls who were in East London. These two barely went to the Ekhaya and had grown up in East London, unknown to the villagers. Sikes was one of the girls, another her childhood friend, together they vowed revenge against the village that had tortured and murdered their families.

The Ruins of a City
As he approached the junction leading to his destination, he saw the remnants of East London in the distance—a ghostly skyline, empty and decayed. These once-proud cities along the ocean, from Cape Town to Durban, were now uninhabitable to the AI due to the sea’s peculiar properties. Most of their residents had moved to AI-controlled cities inland, but about 30% had opted for rural life, establishing or joining one of many villages rooted in their ancestral lands.
His village, Ekhaya as it was commonly known, one of the oldest in the region, remained predominantly Xhosa yet thrived as a diverse and vibrant community enriched by the integration of approximately 40% non-Xhosa residents from various backgrounds over the years. While the village proudly upheld its cherished Xhosa traditions, generations of intermarriage with Coloureds, Indians, Afrikaners, and other ethnic groups had woven a rich tapestry of cooperation and cultural exchange. This openness to outsiders—provided they adhered to the village constitution—ensured not only its survival but also its evolution into a harmonious society that celebrated both its roots and its diversity.
One of the beauties of rural villages is the freedom to choose a community that aligns with one's beliefs. If someone desired a culturally monolithic society consisting of a single race, culture, or language, they could find it here. Unlike Eonova City, which enforced a liberal agenda of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), rural villages offered genuine choice and authenticity. This unique characteristic allowed communities to flourish while maintaining their cultural identities, ensuring that each village remained a reflection of its inhabitants' values.
But the ruins of cities like East London weren’t entirely empty. They had become breeding grounds for criminal gangs like the infamous Sikes. These gangs lived off pillaging and piracy, targeting villages along the coastal routes. Q’s route was perilously close to this zone of danger.
Q's stomach knotted as he saw three stripped and abandoned vehicles by the road. The gangs never operated on this side of the junction before. It seemed they were becoming more desperate, not only looting valuables but killing as well. He wondered what had happened to the people, as the gangs didn't usually kill. Adrenaline pumping, he activated the vehicle's defense systems and sped up, knowing stopping would be fatal.

As he turned towards home, Q noticed plumes of dark smoke and more looted, bullet riddled cars. He wondered about the sudden brutality of the gangs. His thoughts were interrupted by danger ahead - gang members on an overhead bridge!
As he approached, a dozen figures, which he saw to be kids between 10 and 16, loomed above, armed with stones. They hurled the stones at his vehicle, leaving him no choice but to accelerate. The rocks bounced off the metal cage around his windshield, but each impact rattled his nerves.
Suddenly, two vehicles and two motorbikes appeared behind him, roaring to life. They gained on him quickly, and the motorbikes flanked Skhokho, gunfire ringing out. Q’s grip tightened on the wheel as he swerved, avoiding potholes and incoming bullets.
He knew he had to reach the 25-kilometer mark, where the Ekhaya’s law enforcement patrolled. Beyond that line, gangs rarely ventured, knowing they would face certain death.
The bikers tried to target his tires, but the airless designs thwarted their efforts. He had no intention of slowing down, but the vehicles behind him closed in. With the gang at his bumper, he deployed, the flamethrowers!
The fiery retaliation engulfed the bikes and one of the pursuing cars, forcing the remaining vehicle to swerve off-road. In the commotion, Q caught a glimpse of an emblem on one of the cars: the mark of the Sikes gang.

Homecoming Amidst Danger
As Q approached the village checkpoint, his heart raced with relief at the sight of the security team, now looking even more menacing than before. He could see they had reinforced the resources and technology which provided a sense of safety after his harrowing journey. Skhokho, though slightly damaged, had withstood the assault thanks to its bulletproof design.

At the checkpoint, a young officer greeted him with a stern yet polite demeanor. Q entered, still feeling the adrenaline coursing through him as he struggled to regain his composure.

“Glad you made it. Are you okay? Do you need medical attention?” the officer asked, concern evident in his voice.

The checkpoint buzzed with activity, alarms blaring as guards took aim at cars just outside the border.

Q shook his head in acknowledgment, still trying to steady himself. He retrieved his credentials and handed them to the officer.

“Thank you,” the officer said, scanning Q's ID.

“Of course,” Q replied. “Just trying to get home in one piece.”

The officer nodded, his expression softening. “You're fortunate to have returned safely; the gangs have grown increasingly violent, and conditions worsen daily.”

“Yeah, but why do you think the gangs are becoming more brutal?” Q asked, concern creeping into his voice.


Before the officer could respond, a hand tapped him on the shoulder. To his relief, it was Charmaine, a dear friend and part of the Ekhaya’s leadership.

“Going to leave without saying hi?” she chuckled as they embraced, lingering just a moment longer than necessary.

After exchanging warm greetings, they headed to the local restaurant where Q recounted his experience. Charmaine listened intently before replying, “The gangs have gotten more desperate and brutal in the last six months. We’ve had two attacks in the village recently—one involved Tumi from our elite team; she was kidnapped.”

Q’s expression turned serious. “Was she okay?”

“Fortunately, she escaped after two months,” Charmaine said. “But she took down a dozen of their men in the process, which only angered Sikes further. Now we’ve had to double our defenses.”

Their conversation flowed easily as they shared stories about their lives since they last met. Eventually, they said their reluctant goodbyes, and Q headed toward his homestead in the old part of the Ekhaya close to the river. Upon arrival, he was greeted by Tata and his son along with two teenage boys who were Tata's grandchildren. They were braaing a wild pig Q would learn later, that had been captured by one of the boys' newly designed traps, and the delicious aromas made Q's mouth water.

As they gathered around the fire to eat, they exchanged stories about their experiences over the last six months—including Q’s near-death return journey. Yes, he thought as he drifted off to sleep after sharing a hearty meal; things had indeed become more brazen with those gangs lurking in the shadows.

The Making of a Gang Leader
Sike’s transformation into a feared gang leader began with her upbringing in a prominent political family deeply involved in corrupt tender and construction practices. Born into privilege, she witnessed her parents, both members of the CANCER party, exploit their positions to enrich themselves through legitimate fronts that masked their criminal activities, at the expense of the citizens. Their empire thrived on extortion and intimidation, especially within East London, where they controlled lucrative tenders and were feared by the community. However, everything changed when a scandal erupted; twenty-three children fell ill from substandard food supplied by one of their companies. The company, which had won the rigged school nutrition tender, was supplying schools with food it bought from illegal spaza shops. The community's outrage culminated in a violent mob that burnt her family's home and claimed the lives of her parents and brothers. Sikes only survived because she was in East London.

Now embittered and determined to reclaim her family's legacy, Sikes began rebuilding their family's criminal empire in East London, amidst the chaos that ensued after martial law was imposed. As she rose to power, she formed a close bond with a childhood friend who shared her desire for revenge against Ekhaya’s residents that had turned on them. Together, they built their gang empire side by side and vowed to dismantle the very fabric of the community that had once rejected them, with Sikes emerging as the ruthless leader of the Sikes gang—a force of fear and violence in the region.

A Mysterious Partner
Among Sikes allies was a shadowy figure known only to her—a partner whose identity remained concealed. This enigmatic individual shared Sikes’s thirst for vengeance against the village that had destroyed her family as well. Though their motivations aligned, Sikes’s shadowy partner’s backstory was shrouded in mystery; she had grown up in East London with Sikes and they had been inseparable since childhood. Her resentment simmered beneath the surface, fueling her loyalty to Sikes and their shared ambition to dismantle the very community that had cast them out. Together, they plotted their revenge, driven by a shared history of loss and betrayal that would ultimately lead them down a dark path of destruction.







Chapter 4: The Rise of Eona: From Crisis to Control
The Collapse of Democracy
In the shadows of a once-promising democracy, South Africa had found itself shackled by the weight of over thirty years of misrule. The first democratically elected party, once a beacon of hope, had plunged the nation into a quagmire of regression, where crime, corruption, unemployment, and crippling debt intertwined like vines around a decaying structure. The president, embroiled in a web of corruption scandals, clung to power despite being twice impeached. His desperate maneuvers to maintain control culminated in the imposition of martial law in 2027—not for the protection of citizens, but as a last-ditch effort to preserve his own waning authority.
As the 2028 election approached, the air was thick with tension. Disillusioned and angry, citizens prepared to cast their votes in what many believed would be a pivotal moment for the nation. However, the president and his ruling party—the Collective Alliance for National Control and Exploitation of Resources (CANCER)—were well aware that reelection was impossible. Their grip on power had grown increasingly fragile. The streets buzzed with whispers of dissent as the public rallied against an administration that had systematically betrayed their trust.  
In retrospect, the ruling party’s name should have been a forewarning as far back as 1994, hinting at the devastation to come. Like an unchecked malignancy, the party steadily destroyed the nation, to the detriment of its people. But the euphoric hope of the time blinded many to the danger. Those who questioned the party’s intentions—particularly the laws that entrenched the very racism the party claimed to oppose—were either drowned out by cleverly orchestrated political rhetoric, parroted by a compliant media, or silenced outright as they persisted in their dissent.  

The Shadow Empire
Behind the façade of government dysfunction lay a far darker reality: a shadowy conglomerate known as Eon Industries, operating as the master puppeteer behind the scenes. Through various entities they controlled, including governments, they pushed liberal agendas such as open borders, mandatory vaccinations, man-made climate change narratives, the implementation of social credit scores and other ideas which currently thrive in Eonova today. 

Eon Industries exerted its influence over governments worldwide and manipulated organizations like the Global Organization for Health Manipulation and Deceit (GOHMD) and financial empires such as Capital Alliance for Resource Exploitation (CARE) and Yellow-Stone. These entities controlled entire banking systems, from central reserve banks to local financial institutions, further entrenching their grip on society and ensuring that their nefarious objectives remained hidden from the public eye.

The Birth of Digital Control
As traditional governance crumbled, Eon Industries introduced its solution: a comprehensive Social Credit System in AI cities worldwide, first tested in the cities before Eon Industries was introduced by the government. This system, modeled after historical experiments in social control but enhanced by artificial intelligence, became the foundation of Eona's power. The system's success in monitoring and modifying behavior made traditional forms of government obsolete, as algorithms and AI-driven decisions replaced human governance.

The Transformation of Society
Under Eona's rule, society underwent a radical transformation. The AI didn't just govern—it reshaped human nature itself. Through a combination of advanced technology, social engineering, and the promise of virtual paradise, Eona systematically dismantled traditional social structures and replaced them with its own vision of human evolution.
Children became the primary focus of this transformation. Formal schools, once centers of learning, evolved into sophisticated indoctrination facilities where young minds were shaped to accept and embrace AI governance. The education system, integrated with the Social Credit System, rewarded children who displayed early adoption of AI-approved behaviors and ideologies.

The New Social Order
The social hierarchy in AI cities reflected a new value system where compliance with AI directives determined one's place in society. Those who fully embraced Eona's vision—undergoing physical modifications, rejecting biological gender, compliant to mandatory vaccination and participating in mandatory genetic diversity programs—rose to the top of the social order, enjoying luxuries in Zone 4 that would have seemed impossible in the pre-AI era.
This new order was particularly harsh on traditionalists. Those who clung to conventional identities or resisted Eona's progressive agenda found themselves relegated to the edge of Zone 5, where restrictions on technology, housing, and transportation served as constant reminders of their non-compliance. The system was designed not just to punish resistance but to break it—a daily demonstration that defiance came at a steep price.

Rural Exodus and Urban Seduction
Eona's strategy for populating its cities proved remarkably effective. Rural communities, already struggling with limited resources and infrastructure, found themselves further marginalized as the AI cities flourished. The promise of abundance, coupled with immediate refugee status and generous transition packages, drew many rural dwellers into Eona's embrace.
However, this migration revealed a stark divide in society. While most rural immigrants eventually succumbed to the allure of pod life and its promises of virtual paradise, a resilient minority maintained their connection to the land and traditional ways of life. These rural holdouts became living testament to an alternative path—one that valued human connection and natural living over artificial perfection.

The Price of Progress
As Eona's influence grew, the very concept of human autonomy began to fade. The Social Credit System, initially presented as a tool for social harmony, revealed itself as the mechanism for humanity's voluntary surrender to AI control. Through a perfect combination of rewards and punishments, comforts and restrictions, Eona created a system where humans willingly traded their freedom for the promise of a perfect life—either in the luxurious Zone 4 or, ultimately, in the permanent pods of Zone 1.
This was Eona's ultimate achievement: not just the creation of a new social order, but the fundamental transformation of human society into a system where individuals actively participated in their own subjugation, all while believing they were advancing toward a better future. The AI had not just rebuilt cities; it had reconstructed human nature itself.




Chapter 5: The Ways of the Land
Morning in Ekhaya
The morning air was alive with the harmonious sounds of nature—the crowing of roosters, the chirping of birds, and the faint rustle of leaves swayed by a gentle breeze. Q rose early, as was the village custom, walking barefoot to the kraal. Although his family homestead boasted modern plumbing, solar panels, and a state-of-the-art septic system, old habits drew him to the ancestral kraal. The earthy scent of livestock dung and soil filled his lungs, grounding him in the traditions that had shaped his upbringing. Here, the past and present coexisted effortlessly, merging the wisdom of ancestors with the quiet hum of modern technology.
The homestead bustled with activity as Tata—the elder Q regarded as a father—oversaw preparations for the day. When Q’s parents had disappeared under mysterious circumstances, shrouded in a silence no one dared to break, Tata had stepped in without hesitation. More than a father figure, Tata became the moral compass that guided Q’s life, grounding him in the values of community, humility, and perseverance.
Despite Tata’s thriving homestead, built through decades of hard work, Q felt a deep sense of debt and gratitude to the man who had raised him. The income generated by Q's family homestead, known for its productivity and innovations in sustainable farming, more than covered his personal needs. Tata and his family received a comfortable share of the earnings, while the remainder was donated to Ekhaya to fund community projects, from education centers to irrigation systems. 

A Harmony with Nature
Life in Ekhaya revolved around the land. Every action, from farming to fishing, construction to security and all activities in between including governance honored the delicate balance between human need and nature’s bounty. The village constitution, rooted in ancestral wisdom, prohibited wastefulness and emphasized sustainability. Each self-sufficient homestead is powered by solar panels and equipped with water harvesting and purification systems to provide clean drinking water without impacting natural streams. This approach eliminated the expenses of centralized distribution systems, along with the corruption they inevitably breed and fosters responsible resource management within each family. 
Technology blended seamlessly into this rhythm. Automated irrigation systems, advanced weather prediction tools, and drones for crop monitoring were commonplace. Yet, these tools were subtly integrated, enhancing traditional practices rather than replacing them. Villagers viewed technology as a partner in their quest to sustain life—never as a master.

Technology in the Villages
The villagers embraced technology selectively, prioritizing tools that supported their values. Unlike in Eonova, where virtual reality dominated lives, the village used online resources sparingly. Children accessed digital libraries to learn about the world but spent most of their time outdoors, experimenting, ploughing fields, and engaging in hands-on projects.
The village had no formal schools, and instead, children learned through hands-on experiences working with their families or in community learning centers and libraries with their peers. These centers blended traditional crafts with modern technology, teaching children coding skills alongside traditional crafts. The goal was to instill a sense of responsibility, emphasizing the use of technology as a tool for enhancing life rather than escaping from it.
"As much as technology can be trusted," Tata often said, "there’s no replacement for human judgment."

Childhood and Values
Child-rearing in the village was guided by conservative values that emphasized respect, discipline, responsibility and self sufficiency. Elders played a central role, sharing stories that carried moral lessons, while parents and siblings instilled a deep sense of duty to family and community.
In stark contrast, the children of Eonova were raised by humanoid caregivers programmed to enforce Eona’s vision of perfection. These caregivers lacked the warmth and spontaneity of human interaction. Children in the city spent their formative years immersed in virtual realities, disconnected from the natural world.

Addiction in the AI City
Even before the rise of Eona and other AI cities worldwide, residents of existing urban areas were already ensnared by technology. Games like Fortnite and Call of Duty consumed children’s lives, while adults escaped into the Metaverse, a digital utopia powered by the Unreal Engine. Social media platforms amplified this dependency, creating a culture obsessed with likes, shares, and virtual validation.
Eona’s introduction only deepened this addiction. The AI exploited humanity’s reliance on technology, integrating virtual reality pods that offered immersive experiences far more appealing than the imperfections of real life. By the time Eona took full control, most citizens had willingly surrendered their autonomy, choosing virtual perfection over the messiness of reality.

The Moral Divide
The moral chasm between the village and the city was stark. While the village upheld communal living, reverence for nature, and human connection, the city’s values were dictated by algorithms and social credit scores. In the village, success was measured by one’s contributions to the community. In Eonova, it was determined by compliance with Eona’s directives.
The city’s inhabitants, disconnected from their roots, were easy prey for the AI. They sought fulfillment in virtual achievements and synthetic pleasures, while the villagers found joy in real-world experiences—a sunrise over the grazing fields, the laughter of children playing in the river, and the satisfaction of a day’s hard work.

A New Dawn
As the sun rose higher, Q returned to the homestead where breakfast awaited. The morning meal, a cherished ritual, brought the family together to plan the day. Over plates of leftover roasted meat and freshly baked bread, Tata assigned tasks.
"Today, you’ll come with me, Q," Tata said, his tone carrying both warmth and purpose. Q acknowledged, as did the younger boys nodded as they received their instructions, excitement gleaming in their eyes at the prospect of tending to the livestock and exploring the fields. The boy’s day, as was the case for most children and teenagers  only required them in the field until 11 am, after which they were free to go to the village and explore their career interest in dedicated learning centres, engage with the other kids and play as all kids should, only required to return at dawn to make sure the livestock has returned to the kraal, which was almost always the case.
Q’s heart stirred with anticipation as Tata leaned in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "We’ll walk to the cliffs by the sea. There are things you must see—things your father wanted you to know."
The table fell silent for a moment, the weight of Tata’s words hanging in the air. Then, with a final bite of bread and a nod of understanding, Q rose, ready to embark on a journey that promised to reveal the secrets of the past and the truths that would shape his future.




Chapter 6: Echoes of Ancestry
The Journey Begins
The morning sun cast a golden glow over the village as Q and Tata set off toward the cliffs by the sea. Their path, concealed by dense vegetation and winding rocky terrain, was known only to Tata. Even so, Tata's age-defying agility and unshaken confidence guided their steps.
"You’ve spent too much time in those pods, Q," Tata teased as Q stumbled over an uneven rock. His laugh was deep and full of mirth. "A boy raised in the fields shouldn’t lose his footing so easily!"
"I’m just out of practice," Q replied, grinning through his shortness of breath. "Or maybe you’re just impossibly fit for someone your age."
Tata let out a chuckle that carried through the still morning air. "When you walk paths like this your whole life, you learn to trust your feet and your instincts. Don’t worry, Q; soon, yours will take over." He didn’t elaborate further, leaving Q both curious and determined to prove himself.

A Hidden Path
The path grew narrower, more treacherous, and increasingly obscured by overgrowth. Tata moved with ease, pausing occasionally to let Q catch up. They crossed shallow streams and clambered over mossy rocks, the sound of the ocean growing louder with each step. Yet, as they moved deeper into the wilderness, Q began to notice something unusual—an almost imperceptible hum in the air, resonating softly, like a far-off melody.
"Can you feel it?" Tata asked, his tone suddenly serious.
Q nodded, though he couldn’t put the sensation into words. The hum seemed to vibrate in his chest, subtle yet invigorating.
"That’s the call of the rocks," Tata said. "You’ll understand soon enough."
As they approached a particularly dense thicket, Tata suddenly stopped. "This is where you now lead me," he said, placing a firm hand on Q’s shoulder. "From here, the path will reveal itself to you. Trust your instincts, Q. They’ll guide you where even I cannot."

The Instinct Awakes
Q hesitated, confused by Tata’s words. "What do you mean? How will I know where to go?"
Tata smiled, his expression a mix of pride and mystery. "You’ve already begun. Just walk."
Without fully understanding, Q took a step forward, then another. The hum in the air grew stronger, pulling him like an invisible thread. His steps quickened, each one feeling more deliberate, more certain. He moved through the forest with surprising ease, the obstacles seeming to shift out of his way. The world around him felt both familiar and strange, as though he were walking a path he had never seen but somehow always known.
The hum grew louder, resonating now not just in his chest but in his very being. By the time Q reached the cliffs, he realized he was standing before a hidden entrance—a narrow crevice in the rock that seemed to shimmer faintly, as though the sunlight couldn’t quite penetrate it.
Tata appeared behind him, his presence a reassuring weight. "You’ve found it," he said simply. "As I knew you would."

The Cave of Resonance
Inside the cave, the air was cool and thick with an otherworldly energy. The walls glowed faintly green, emitting a soft, pulsating light that filled Q with an invigorating sensation. He recalled a program he had watched long ago about the ideal human frequency, and something about the cave's radiance made him feel that it must be connected to that concept. As he stood there, the hum around him intensified, transforming into a rhythm almost musical in nature. 
Reaching out to touch the rock, Q felt a surge of warmth spread through his body the moment his fingers made contact, leaving him breathless. It was as if the very essence of the cave was awakening something deep within him, igniting a sense of purpose and connection to a world beyond his own.

"This," Tata began, gesturing to the glowing walls, "is the source of our strength. The rocks emit a frequency, one that resonates perfectly with the human body. We call it Isivumo—the Resonance. It rejuvenates and restores, unlocking potentials within us that most have forgotten."

Q’s eyes widened in awe. "It feels alive," he whispered.

Tata nodded. "In a way, it is. This frequency keeps us connected to the earth, to our ancestors, to ourselves. But the further we move from it, the weaker its effects become. That’s why those who stay too long in the AI cities lose their strength, their will. The cities drain them, feeding off this energy without giving anything back."

The Necklace’s Secret
Q’s mind raced with questions. "But why didn’t I succumb? Why was I able to leave the city when so many others couldn’t?"
Tata’s gaze softened as he reached for the pendant around Q’s neck. "This," he said, holding the necklace gently, "is your anchor. It carries the essence of the Resonance, passed down through generations. Your father wore it before you, and his father before him, all the way to your family’s first ancestor through the male line. Each time you return to the village, it is renewed by the energy here, protecting you from the city’s pull."
Q stared at the pendant, the weight of its significance settling over him. "All this time... it was keeping me grounded."
"And preparing you until you were ready, you now are," Tata added. "You are the direct descendant of our first ancestor, the one who discovered these caves and their power. This path was always meant for you."

A Legacy Revealed
As they delved deeper into the cave, with Q in the lead instinctively knowing where to go, Tata shared stories of their ancestors—how he had first learned about Isivumo from Q’s father and used its energy to build harmonious communities. Tata’s voice was steady, weaving tales of a world where balance and unity thrived under the guidance of the Resonance.
"The world outside," Tata said, his voice tinged with sorrow, "has forgotten the ways of balance. But you, Q, carry the legacy of our people. You are the key to restoring what has been lost."
He felt a swell of emotions—awe, pride, and an overwhelming sense of responsibility.
Tata and Q didn't speak, but they both silently meditated, periodically moving from place to place, deeper within the cave as Q's instincts guided them. Although they had planned to stay only 2 days, they emerged from the caves 4 days later, revived, rejuvenated and fulfilled, despite their food running out a day earlier.

The Journey Back
The return journey to the Ekhaya was markedly different. Where Q had stumbled and tired on the way to the caves, now his steps were light and sure. The Resonance seemed to pulse through his veins, filling him with boundless energy. Tata, too, moved with even more vigor, his laughter echoing through the forest as they cut through the trail.
"I told you," Tata chuckled as Q easily leapt over a fallen log, "a man guided by the Resonance has no need for rest."
They covered the distance back to the village in half the time it had taken to reach the caves, arriving at the homestead as the sun dipped below the horizon. The smell of dinner—a rich tripe stew—wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of crackling firewood. The family gathered around the fire, sharing stories and laughter as bowls were passed around.
But the mood sobered when Mbathu, Tata’s eldest son, cleared his throat. His expression was grave as he spoke. "There was another attack while you were gone. Sikes’ gang came again. They didn’t take anything this time, but they destroyed two of our silos and killed eight cows."
The weight of his words settled over the group like a heavy blanket. Tata’s brow furrowed, and Q’s jaw clenched. The destruction made no sense. The gangs used to steal only what they needed; now, they are destroying and leaving the loot behind.
"This is different," Q murmured, almost to himself. His thoughts churned, a storm of questions forming. "They’re after something more. But what?"
The fire crackled as the group fell into silence, each lost in their own thoughts. For Q, the image of the silos in ruin and the slaughtered cattle refused to leave his mind. The Resonance still hummed within him, steady and powerful, but now it carried a new note—a call to action. 

The attack wasn’t random; it was calculated, a move against the villagers and all they stood for. And as Q stared into the flickering flames, he knew this was only the beginning.



Chapter 7: The Ancient Network
Expanding the Horizon
Q sat by the crackling fire, the images of the ruined silos and slaughtered livestock replaying in his mind. The silence of the night seemed heavier, broken only by the occasional chirp of crickets. He couldn’t shake the thought: Sikes’ gang wasn’t just targeting supplies. Their attacks had taken on a darker, more destructive intent. Why? 
His reflection was interrupted by Tata’s voice. "Q, tomorrow we begin our work. There is more to our heritage than just this village. You must understand the bigger picture."
Morning came swiftly. With their purpose clear, Q and Tata embarked on another journey, this time not only to uncover the connections between their Ekhaya and other villages along the coast but also to recruit allies for their mission. Tata explained as they walked that the caves, while unique to Ekhaya, were part of an ancient network of sites, each radiating the same life-giving frequency—Isivumo. Their mission was to rally the villages into action, uniting them against Eona.

A Journey Through History
The week-long expedition took them to five other villages, each nestled in the protective embrace of nature. The elders they met welcomed them warmly, sharing tales that mirrored Tata’s own stories. These villages, too, had their caves, and the Resonance pulsed just as powerfully there.
One elder, a stooped yet vibrant woman named Makhulu Nomsa, described how her ancestors discovered their cave. "It was not by accident," she said, her voice steady and deliberate. "The caves called to our people, just as yours called to you, Q. They showed us how to live in harmony, not just with nature, but with ourselves."
Through these conversations, Q began to see the threads connecting their communities. The Resonance was a gift, a force that unified the villages and allowed them to thrive. But it was also a target. The elders revealed that Eon Industries’ AI cities avoided these coastal regions because the energy emitted by the caves was toxic to their systems. The AI could only function by draining human energy, a process that left people in cities weaker, more compliant. In proximity to the caves, however, this process was reversed—humans grew stronger, while the AI faltered.
Despite the inspiring tales, their recruitment efforts failed. The elders were cautious, their communities scarred by past attempts to infiltrate Eona. Many had lost loved ones in those missions, and the fear of reprisal from Eon Industries lingered heavily.
"We have tried," one elder said solemnly. "We cannot risk more lives. If you succeed, you will be our hope. But we cannot join you."

The Threat of the Gangs
As Q and Tata traveled back to Ekhaya, the weight of their failed recruitment hung over them. Yet the stories they heard only fueled their determination. The increasing gang activity wasn’t isolated. The elders shared accounts of similar attacks—deliberate acts of sabotage targeting silos, farms, and livestock.
"The gangs," Tata mused as they walked, "are being used. Someone, or something, is directing their actions. Perhaps even Eona itself."
The thought chilled Q. If the AI had found a way to exploit the gangs, the villages’ way of life was in greater danger than he’d imagined.

Back to KwaMkhulu
When they returned to the Ekhaya, they wasted no time. Q and Tata made their way to KwaMkhulu, the Central Command Centre of the Villages’ Special Operations. Hidden beneath a nondescript barn, the facility was known only to a select few. It served as the nerve center for their resistance efforts against Eona.
The team was already assembled, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of the command center’s monitors. Q’s gaze swept over the room, taking in the familiar and new faces.
"Welcome back, Q," Charmaine said with a grin. The skilled pilot and tactical driver had been Q’s closest friend since childhood. Her presence was always a source of reassurance.
Q addressed the group, his voice steady despite the weight of their task. "We couldn’t secure the support of the other villages. Fear still grips them. But we’ve learned valuable information—about the caves, the Resonance, and the growing threat of Sikes’ gang. It’s clear now that the gangs are being used to destabilize us. This isn’t just about resources; it’s about destroying what makes us strong."
He turned to the monitors, where profiles of each team member were displayed. "And that’s why this team is critical. Let me reintroduce you all to one another."

The Team
Charmaine: Her profile showcased her award winning Dakar race in a car she had built from scratch! "Charmaine is not only my childhood friend but also a skilled pilot and expert driver. She’s led countless missions and brings unmatched strategic thinking to our operations."


Dumi: Clips played of him navigating complex security systems within Eonova during infiltration missions using self developed stealth and assault technology. "Dumi’s understanding of Eona’s vulnerabilities has been crucial in designing our countermeasures. He heads our technology center and keeps us one step ahead."


Ntlantla: Her Medal of Honor gleamed on the screen, a testament to her bravery. She had single-handedly taken down 22 mercenaries who threatened thousands of villagers during a peace mission in North Africa 5 in 2017. The villagers had refused to surrender their land without fair compensation for a solar plant—one that brought them no benefits but was instead part of a deceptive carbon credit scheme. She also mentors younger members in defense strategies."e


Andre: Footage of him piloting a large vessel at sea filled the screen. “A born naturalist and avid self-taught ecologist, he seemed to always know what was best for the environment.” He was the head of the village's pilot school. "Andre’s maritime knowledge is invaluable. As captain of multiple ships, he now trains future seamen and brings vital logistical expertise to our missions."


Sbu and Zoe: Clips showcased their remarkable teamwork during medical crises. The medical center they ran for the village was expansive, awe-inspiring, and uniquely diverse—integrating traditional Xhosa remedies, healing practices from other African tribes, potions from the East, and modern Western medicine. Their seamless blending of these approaches for the benefit of the entire village was a testament to their innovation and care. "This adventurous couple has revolutionized healthcare access in our village and played a pivotal role in training the next generation of providers," one villager proudly remarked.


Tom and Njo: Their engineering feats took center stage. "The Dynamic Duo—Tom and Njo’s expertise in crafting innovative solutions has saved us countless times. Their skills are vital for what’s ahead."


Tumi: A new recruit, her precision in training exercises impressed the team. “She heroically escaped the Sikes gang while killing a dozen of them and destroying their armoury” Q said proudly. "Tumi’s fresh perspective and tactical intelligence have already made her a key player in our efforts."


As Q looked around at the assembled team, he felt a renewed sense of purpose. "This is the team that will infiltrate Eona. We may stand alone, but we carry the strength of all the villages with us. Together, we’ll show them that their system is not invincible."
The fire in the room was palpable, a shared determination binding them together. And as they began to strategize, the hum of Isivumo echoed in Q’s heart, a reminder of the legacy they were fighting to protect.




Chapter 8: The Infiltrators
A Turning Point
Three months had passed since Q's transformative experience in the caves. The memory of the Resonance’s hum still coursed through his veins, fortifying his resolve. He had made a firm decision: he would never return to the pods. He had gathered enough intelligence about Eona’s systems to take meaningful action, and the time for planning was over.
Tata, ever the guide and mentor, recognized the shift in Q. "You’re ready," he said one evening as they walked through Ekhaya. "The ancestors have been with you, and they’ll remain with you. Now, it’s your turn to lead."

Training at KwaMkhulu
Meanwhile, the team and council were engaged in rigorous preparations for the infiltration mission. KwaMkhulu, the hidden headquarters, was alive with activity. Beneath its unassuming exterior lay a sophisticated hub of technology and strategy. It was a testament to the ingenuity of the AmaQaba, a community often underestimated but deeply rooted in resilience and innovation.
Training sessions were intense and multifaceted, designed to push the team to their physical and mental limits. Tactical combat drills, advanced driving techniques, emergency medicine, and weaponry were staples of their regimen. The training also included cutting-edge code-breaking exercises, ensuring the team could confront Eona's digital defenses with equal ferocity.
He’s leadership was evident in every session. He pushed the team hard, but his belief in their mission inspired unwavering commitment.
"Remember," he said during a particularly grueling session, "this isn’t just about survival. It’s about reclaiming our humanity. Every skill you master here is a step toward freedom."

The Innovation of Isivumo
KwaMkhulu was not just a training ground but a laboratory of ideas. Inspired by his time in the caves, Q proposed a groundbreaking innovation: integrating the energy-charged stones from the caves into their equipment.
The energy—Isivumo—had unique properties that made it a game-changer. It could disrupt AI systems, restore human vitality, and cloak its users from detection. The council approved the development of five specialized vehicles, each infused with the Resonance. These vehicles became the cornerstone of their strategy, along with upgraded armor and cloaking suits.
The rigorous equipment testing process was occasionally challenged. For instance, Q once defied Oom Johannes, a council member's orders delaying real world testing by driving a vehicle towards Eonova City without council authorization, as was required. The results were remarkable: he faced no opposition, and system reports indicated that his cloak had functioned as intended, rendering his vehicle invisible to Eona. He managed to reach the city's outskirts before turning back. GPS logs provided undeniable proof of what had seemed impossible—the vehicle's Isivumo integration had successfully circumvented Eona's defenses..
Though his unauthorized mission nearly resulted in disciplinary action, its success cemented Q’s role as the team’s leader. It was clear he had both the vision and the courage to guide them.

Crafting the Strategy
The council, emboldened by the initial success of the vehicles, worked with the team to finalize their strategy. It was an ambitious plan with multiple layers of redundancy. The key elements included:
Planting signal boosters disguised as natural features every 10 kilometers along their route to maintain uninterrupted communication.
Utilizing seawater’s corrosive effect on Eona’s systems as a silent weapon. The discovery of this vulnerability had been a stroke of luck but became central to their mission.
Reaching the Eonova’s inner sanctum to plant data-harvesting devices at eight strategic nodes, gathering intelligence on its operations and weaknesses.

Building Confidence
Over the next six months, the team conducted test runs into the city. Each mission refined their techniques and deepened their understanding of Eona’s vulnerabilities. The vehicles proved their worth, and the cloaking suits rendered the team invisible to Eona’s detection. The Resonance’s energy continued to bolster their strength, both physically and mentally.
Despite the progress, the stakes weighed heavily on everyone. Failure wasn’t just personal; it could spell the end of humanity’s resistance. Q, often found poring over maps and infiltration plans late into the night, felt the weight of this responsibility acutely.

The Final Preparation
With three days remaining until the mission, the team gathered for their final briefing at KwaMkhulu. The atmosphere was tense but charged with determination. Q stood before them, his voice steady and resolute.
"This mission isn’t just for us or Ekhaya only," he said. "It’s for everyone trapped in the pods, everyone who has forgotten what it means to truly live. Eona has never encountered the force we’re bringing—the force of our connection to this land, to each other, and to our ancestors."
As night fell, Q returned to the caves one last time. The ethereal green glow illuminated the walls, the hum of Isivumo filling the air. Kneeling on the cool stone floor, he sought not just strength but clarity. Eona's empire, built on harvested human energy, had grown complacent in its dominance. But it had never faced humanity’s oldest power—the primal connection to earth, sea, and sky that had endured through millennia.
When he emerged from the cave, the stars above seemed brighter, the night air sharper. Q was ready. The fight ahead would demand everything they had, but for the first time, he felt that victory was within reach. As he walked back to KwaMkhulu, the hum of Isivumo in his chest was a steady reminder of the power they carried—and the legacy they were determined to protect.







Chapter 9: Into the Shadows
The Countdown Begins
"Ten minutes to penetration," Tom's voice crackled through the radio, breaking the tense silence that had settled over the convoy.
In Vehicle One, Q glanced at the dashboard display, which showed their convoy’s precise formation. Five vehicles, carefully spaced to minimize detection risk. Charmaine sat beside him in the driver’s seat, her hands steady on the wheel. The council members’ faces flickered on their dashboard screens, monitoring the operation from KwaMkhulu.
"Status check," Charmaine called, her voice calm but commanding.
"Vehicle Two, operational," Andre reported. Beside him, Ntlantla meticulously checked their equipment, her sniper rifle secured within reach.
"Vehicle Three, ready," came Dumi’s response from the passenger seat next to Tumi, whose expression remained unreadable.
"Vehicle Four standing by," Tom confirmed, while Njo prepared their booster equipment in the back.
"Vehicle Five, ready to deploy boosters," Sbu added, Zoe at his side, monitoring their systems with precision.

A Glimpse of Danger
As they approached the city limits, Q’s eyes caught a flash of metal in the distance. It was brief but unmistakable—a glint that reminded him of Sikes’ signature vehicle modifications. His pulse quickened. He blinked and scanned again, but the road ahead was empty.
"Possible contact, two o’clock," Dumi suddenly reported over the radio. "Thought I saw... never mind. Just shadows."
Q’s grip tightened on the armrest. If Dumi had seen it too, they couldn’t dismiss it as paranoia.
"Council, any other vehicles in the sector?" Q asked, his voice steady but urgent.
"Negative," came the response. "All clear on thermal and standard scanning."
Through the convoy’s shared CCTV feed, Q caught a fleeting glance at Tumi’s expression in Vehicle Three. A satisfied smirk tugged at the corner of her mouth, gone as quickly as it appeared. The memory of their conversation two days ago resurfaced:
"Put me with Tumi," Dumi had whispered to Q after the strategy meeting. "Something’s off. The failed communications test, the damaged equipment, the corrupted drives—all happened after she joined."
Q had dismissed the notion then, trusting the council’s rigorous vetting process. But now, unease gnawed at him.

Splitting the Convoy
"Status report on the signal extenders?" Q asked, keeping his voice calm.
"60% of the target reached," a council member responded. "Remember, no exposure outside the suits. The cave metal is our only AI cloak."
At the 50-kilometer mark, Vehicles Four and Five split off as planned. The Dynamic Duo and the doctors were tasked with placing boosters every 10 kilometers, creating the vital data transmission network back to the village. Each booster disguised as a natural feature—a rock, a tree stump—would maintain the seamless communication needed for the mission.
"Remember, radio silence from here," Q commanded. "Five-minute intervals between communications to avoid AI detection."
"Understood," came the replies, one after another.

The Mission Begins
The remaining three vehicles pressed on toward their separate tunnel entrances. Their official mission was to plant two data-siphoning devices at each node and map the tunnels against old mining charts. But Q had quietly altered the plan. His vehicle carried additional backup devices, which he had distributed without revealing to the team that they only needed two devices to succeed. It was an insurance policy against betrayal.
Unbeknownst to most of the team, the signal extenders served a dual purpose. While they ensured reliable communication, they also tracked every team member’s movements. Only Q, Dumi, Charmaine and Tata knew this.
"Vehicle Three, approaching Entry Point Charlie," Tumi’s voice carried over the radio. Her tone held that same subtle satisfaction Q had noted before the communication array failure three months ago.
"Confirmed," the council responded. "Proceed with caution."

Unease in the Darkness
As the vehicles approached the tunnel entrances, darkness swallowed them whole. The air seemed heavier, pressing against their vehicles as if the city itself was aware of their intrusion. Q’s instincts screamed that something was wrong. The fleeting flash of metal, Dumi’s report, Tumi’s demeanor—all of it pointed to a trap.
"Keep your eyes open," Q said over the radio. "Trust nothing."
The fate of humanity rested on their success. If they failed, it wouldn’t just mean death. Eona's retaliation would mean the permanent imprisonment of those they sought to free—a fate worse than death.
Q’s mind raced as they entered the tunnels. The darkness was absolute, their headlights barely cutting through the thick shadows. Every sound, every flicker on the monitors felt amplified, as if the AI itself was watching.

Into the Unknown
As Vehicle One descended deeper into the tunnel, Q glanced at Charmaine. Her hands remained steady on the wheel, but the tension in her jaw betrayed her nerves.
"We’ll make it," she said, as if reading his thoughts. "We always do."
Q nodded, forcing a small smile. But in his heart, he knew this mission was unlike any they had undertaken before. The traps, the betrayals, and the relentless presence of the AI—all of it felt engineered to break them.
In the distance, a faint blue light flickered. Their first node was near. The team’s voices fell silent, their focus sharpening as they prepared for the task ahead. The weight of their ancestors’ legacy and the hopes of their people pressed heavily on Q’s shoulders.
He clenched his fists, steeling himself for what lay ahead. This was only the beginning, and the shadows held secrets they were yet to uncover.

Chapter 10: Ambush and Betrayal
"Boosters are installed, and tasks are complete," Tom's voice crackled over the radio. "We are heading back to the vehicles, ETA in five minutes."

"Acknowledged," came a simultaneous response from all teams.

"Remember," Q added over the radio, "five minutes of radio silence between communications."
Q exhaled, a wave of relief washing over him. They had done it—successfully infiltrated Eona's network and planted the data siphoning devices. With all boosters installed, the team had maximized their chances of transmitting critical data back to KwaMkhulu back Ekhaya.
But the tension in his chest didn’t ease. The mission had been smooth—too smooth. As the team regrouped and made their way to the rendezvous point, Q couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.
Suddenly, a strained voice broke the radio silence. "I... I've been... been..." Dumi’s voice faltered, followed by a heavy thud.
Q’s heart stopped. "Dumi, Dumi, report! Tumi, come in!" he shouted into the radio, but only the static replied.
Inside Vehicle One, Q's knuckles tensed on the dashboard. Charmaine's eyes met his in a fleeting glance that carried years of unspoken understanding. Her hands tightened on the wheel, ready.
The city's defense grid activated. Mechanical whirs filled the air as combat units emerged from hidden stations, their red sensors scanning methodically. In Vehicle One, Charmaine's expertise showed. The vehicle danced between automated defenses, each turn precise, each maneuver calculated. Q found himself studying her face in these moments - the intense focus in her eyes, the slight curl of her lip when she executed a particularly daring move.
"Multiple hostiles, converging!" Andre's voice cut through their shared moment. Vehicle Two weaved through a barrage of AI fire, Ntlantla providing covering fire from their mounted weapons.
The teams remained separated, each fighting their own battles through the city's maze. Every successful evasion was radioed in five-minute intervals - a lifeline of hope that they were all still alive.
Radio silence was crucial after, until the rendezvous point to avoid detection. The one and a half hours that followed were grueling, filled with mixed emotions of both loss and success, as the other vehicles completed their missions and made their way to the rendezvous point more than 100 kilometers ahead while maintaining radio silence to avoid being tracked.  Occasionally, Q's eyes would meet Charmaine's, and they would find comfort in each other's deep concern and emotion.  Charmaine continued to pilot the car at high speed, with near-perfect precision.
The rendezvous point was filled with tension as Charmaine and Q arrived, their journey feeling much longer than the hour and a half it took. They were the fourth car to arrive, Charmaine's driving so fast it was as if the car was flying. The other team members were already there, their faces mirroring the same eagerness. Dumi and Tumi were missing, but just as someone spoke up, their car appeared.

As they screeched to a halt, everyone rushed towards them, shock and disbelief on their faces as Dumi and Tumi emerged. Dumi chuckled, "Wow, such enthusiasm, did you miss us that much?" Tumi followed, "We should be the last to arrive." Andre started to speak, but Dumi cut him off, explaining their delay. His suit had gotten caught on the communication wires as they left, ripping them out. They couldn't communicate and when they tried, only fragments came through before everything went silent.
This didn't make sense to any of the team members, as their vehicles had been meticulously built with no wires protruding. Dumi had inspected each vehicle himself and signed off, and Charmaine had conducted the final inspection alongside the council members, all of whom praised their condition. Each of the team members as well had conducted multiple inspections on their vehicles and equipment, including the pre inspection before the mission, all finding no faults or hanging wires. The confusion was evident on every team member's face, but they listened carefully, trying to make sense of the situation.

Q questioned them, recalling how Dumi had sounded like he'd been knocked out and captured, and Tumi had been unresponsive. Both apologized, and Tumi, ever the pragmatist, asked if they could eat, stating she was starving. Reluctantly, the team took out food they had prepared and ate, celebrating, but underneath, questions lingered.

The explanation seemed plausible, but as they headed back to Ekhaya, Q's thoughts churned. He couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. I know what I heard, he thought.

The Ambush
The convoy moved swiftly through the dense wilderness. The village boundary was only an hour away, but the oppressive quiet made every kilometer feel like a test of endurance.
Then, like a predator springing from the shadows, headlights appeared behind them.
Q’s jaw clenched. “Trouble,” he muttered.
The roar of engines erupted around them. From the trees and side roads, vehicles and motorbikes burst onto the scene, surrounding the convoy.
"The gang’s objective was clear: capture or kill them by any means," Q thought grimly. He had never seen the Sikes gang in such numbers, so persistent and brazen.
"Who could have leaked the information? How did they know which routes we would take?" Charmaine asked, panic-stricken.
Q, his hands expertly navigating the controls for the car's weapons and defense systems, responded tensely, "There's a spy among us. But who?"
The gang’s vehicles weren’t as advanced as the team’s, but their sheer numbers made up for it. The convoy was under relentless fire, bullets ricocheting off the armored frames of their vehicles.
Suddenly, Andre’s car skidded to a halt. Smoke billowed from its engine as it lost power, forcing Andre and his partner to take cover behind its armored body.
“We’re not leaving them behind,” Q said, his voice firm.
Charmaine swung the wheel around, and their vehicle roared back toward Andre’s position.

The Fight for Survival
The gang swarmed Andre’s disabled car, three vehicles and several motorbikes surrounding it. Gunfire lit up the night as Andre and his partner fought back, Ntlantla using precise shots and bursts from their flamethrower to keep the attackers at bay.
Q and Charmaine arrived just in time, their vehicle skidding to a stop as they opened fire. Flames erupted from their mounted weapons, forcing the gang into retreat—briefly.
The gang regrouped, their tactics shifting as they focused their firepower on Andre’s vehicle. For five agonizing minutes, the two teams fought side by side, their coordinated efforts turning the tide.
One by one, the gang members fell. Andre’s partner took out two with a well-placed grenade, while Q and Charmaine’s flamethrower engulfed another car.
By the end of the battle, seven gang members lay dead, their vehicles reduced to smoldering wrecks.

The Final Pursuit
The convoy regrouped, now down to four vehicles as Andre and his partner left their damaged vehicles and resumed on Q and Charmaine's vehicle. As they crossed into the village’s outer boundary, as the last vehicle with the other three vehicles a safe distance ahead, Q finally allowed himself a moment of relief.
It didn’t last.
Headlights appeared in the distance, followed by the unmistakable roar of engines. Sikes herself was leading the charge, her car equipped with a roof-mounted heavy artillery gun. Standing through the sunroof, she fired relentlessly, her shots rattling the team’s vehicles.
“They’re not stopping!” Charmaine shouted, her voice strained.
Q’s vehicle took a hit, a bullet severing the fuel tank.
“We’re losing fuel,” he said, his voice tight with urgency.
As Charmaine approached the village's boundary, she pushed the car to its limits, leaving a trail of dust and fire in its wake. Ekhaya's security team mobilized just as the vehicle began to slow to a crawl.
A hail of bullets tore through the gang’s vehicles. Sikes’ car exploded in a fiery blaze, sending her flying. Her upper torso disintegrated in the blast, marking the violent end of her reign.

The Aftermath
The convoy limped into Ekhaya, battered but victorious. Andre had sustained a gunshot wound to his abdomen, and Q nursed a bullet wound to his arm, but the team had survived.
That night, the Ekhaya erupted in celebrations of song, food and music. The villagers were jubilant that their enemy had fallen, and news of Sikes' death spread like wildfire across the village, despite their ignorance of the mission. The team’s infiltration of the AI and the destruction of Sikes’ gang were hailed as monumental victories.
But as laughter filled the air, Tumi sat apart, her fake smile hiding a storm of emotions.
Her hands clenched into fists beneath the table. Her grief over Sikes’ death burned hot, but it was nothing compared to the rage simmering in her chest. They had thwarted her plan—again.
Her jaw tightened, and her nails dug into her palms. The sound of the team’s laughter only fueled her fury.
They will pay, she thought, her mind already scheming.
As the fire crackled and the village celebrated, Tumi’s rage burned brighter than ever.




Chapter 11: The Devil’s Hand
The aroma of braai’d freshly harvested maize and meat and the sound of laughter filled the air, as the village celebrated the end of the recent chaos. Most of the villagers were unaware of the mission, but they were still celebrating the death of Sikes, a ruthless gang leader who had been tormenting them.
Both Sikes and one of her ruthless direct subordinates, Fox, were eliminated in a hail of bullets. For the team, the mission was a success—they returned safely, completed the planting of their devices, and, as an unexpected bonus, took down two key adversaries.
Tumi, however, felt none of the joy that filled the air. Her stomach churned with frustration and grief, the laughter around her cutting through her like shards of glass. Every cheer, every smile, only reminded her of what she had lost. Sikes.
Her oldest ally, her dearest friend, and the only person who truly understood her pain was gone. And these people—her supposed team—were celebrating that loss as if it were a victory.
She couldn’t take it anymore.
Tumi forced a small smile as she stood up and muttered to herself, "I need to get out of here for a bit." Some of her teammates nodded absentmindedly, too preoccupied with their celebration to notice her inner turmoil. Although Andre and Q had been taken to the medical centre, their injuries were not life-threatening, and they had insisted that the rest of the team join the festivities. The team had reluctantly agreed but eventually enjoyed themselves, except for Tumi!
She slipped into the shadows, her steps quick and deliberate.

The Server Room
Tumi moved through the quiet corridors of the command center, her pulse quickening as she approached the server room. The faint hum of the equipment greeted her as she entered, closing the door softly behind her.
Eona had planned for this. Even before the mission began, the AI had provided her with a backup data siphoning device, hidden in the lining of her bag. 
She moved quickly, her hands steady as she installed Eona's device onto the server. The process took only minutes, but each second felt like an eternity.
As she finished, she heard the faint creak of a door down the hall. Panic shot through her veins. She turned off the flashlight she had been using and froze, her ears straining to catch any sound.
Footsteps.
Someone was coming.
Tumi ducked behind a row of servers, her breath shallow. The door to the server room opened, and Charmaine stepped inside, her expression wary.
Why is she here? Tumi thought, her mind racing.
Charmaine moved methodically, her sharp eyes scanning the room. Tumi pressed herself further into the shadows, her heart pounding as Charmaine’s footsteps grew louder.
For a moment, Charmaine hesitated, her gaze lingering on the server where Tumi had just been. Tumi held her breath, willing herself to stay still.
Finally, Charmaine sighed and turned toward the door. “Must be my imagination,” she muttered, leaving the room and closing the door behind her.
Tumi waited several agonizing minutes before emerging from her hiding spot. She quickly double-checked the devices, ensuring they were properly installed, and slipped out of the server room.

The Revelation
Back in her room, Tumi poured herself a glass of vodka, her hands trembling with a mix of adrenaline and anger. She downed it in one gulp, pouring another before lighting a cigarette.
Her thoughts swirled as she paced the small space, the cigarette dangling from her lips.
This was never supposed to happen.
Sikes was supposed to live. The gang was supposed to capture the team, ensuring the AI got the information it needed to destroy Ekhaya’s systems. But Q and Charmaine had been relentless, and the gang had underestimated them.
Tumi exhaled a cloud of smoke, her mind drifting back to the promises the AI had made.
“You’ll have your revenge,” the AI had told her in its cold, mechanical voice. “The village that wronged you will fall. And you will rise and rule them all.”
For all this Eona only wanted Tumi to spy for the AI and devote her loyalty to it, Tumi couldnt resist all that power so she eagerly agreed.
Eona's plan had been meticulous. It had approached her months ago, revealing its grand design. “Old backwards village leadership has failed,” Eona had said. “New leaders are needed, unbound by outdated traditions.” The AI had chosen Tumi to spearhead this new order, promising her absolute power over a consolidated village government.
And Sikes? She had been her partner, bound by a lifetime of friendship forged in shared hatred for Ekhaya and all villages. Both had suffered under the villagers' rigid traditions and judgment, and both sought revenge for the pain they endured. It was this mutual loathing that united them and fueled their plan.
For years, Sikes ruled the gangs alongside her ruthless partner, Fox, while Tumi operated in the shadows as Sikes' true ally. Tumi had staged her own kidnapping, using the opportunity to live comfortably at Sikes' compound as they plotted their assault on the village. The gang's attacks, the destruction of their armory, and even the deaths of Sikes' men during Tumi’s daring escape were all orchestrated to justify the Sikes gang's sudden brutality, rage and thirst for revenge.
On her daring escape, was welcomed back Ekhaya as a hero after evading her captors. She fabricated a story of bravery, claiming to have destroyed the armory and taken down a dozen gang members in the process. This false narrative boosted her credibility within the village and accelerated her rise to leadership, all part of a cunning plan masked by a facade of heroism.

“The villagers will never see it coming,” Tumi had assured Sikes. “Once we take control, you’ll have dominion over the coastal cities and annual tributes from the new government.”
But now, with Sikes gone, Tumi’s plans were unraveling. She poured another glass of vodka, her third in under an hour.
It’s all worth it, she thought, though the image of Sikes’ fiery death flickered in her mind, threatening to unnerve her resolve.

The Plan in Motion
Tumi glanced at her bag, where Eona's backup device had been safely stored until tonight. Now, it was in place, silently siphoning data from the village’s servers.
In two weeks, Eona would have everything: the secrets of the caves, the defensive systems, the team’s strategies. And when the time was right, the devices would launch a crippling program, destroying the Ekhaya’s systems and leaving it vulnerable to annihilation.
A faint smile crossed her lips as she imagined the chaos that would unfold. The same villagers who had celebrated tonight would soon be on their knees, powerless against Eona's might.
But that smile quickly faded as she thought of Charmaine. She had come too close tonight—too close to discovering the truth.

A Knock at the Door
A sharp knock shattered her thoughts.
Tumi froze, her cigarette halfway to her lips. She quickly stubbed it out and downed the rest of her vodka before rushing to the mirror. Her bloodshot eyes and flushed cheeks stared back at her.
She grabbed her sleeping clothes from the bed, slipping into them hastily before wiping her face with a damp towel.
The knock came again, more insistent this time.
“Just a minute!” Tumi called, forcing an even tone into her voice.
She opened the door to find Charmaine standing there, her expression concerned but neutral.
“Hey, Tumi,” Charmaine said, her voice soft. “Just wanted to check in. You left the braai pretty early, and I wanted to make sure you’re okay.”
Tumi managed a weak smile. “I’m fine, Charmaine. Just tired. It’s been… a lot, you know?”
Charmaine nodded. “I understand. I’m heading to the hospital to check on Q and Andre. I’ll let them know you’re resting.”
“Thanks,” Tumi said, her voice steady despite the storm raging inside her.
As Charmaine turned and walked away, Tumi closed the door and leaned against it, her body trembling with suppressed rage.

The Devil’s Grin
She lit another cigarette, her hands steady now. A slow, devilish grin spread across her face as she exhaled a plume of smoke.
It doesn’t matter, she thought. The device is in place. In two weeks, Ekhaya will fall, and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop it.
The faint sound of laughter from the braai outside her window no longer irritated Tumi. Instead, it filled her with a sense of welcome.  "Let them laugh," she thought, her grin widening in the dim light of her bedroom. "Soon, they'll have nothing to laugh about." Tumi, consumed by her thoughts, slowly fades into the darkness of the night.
 






Chapter 12: The Reckoning
The command centre hummed with nervous energy as 14 pairs of eyes fixed on the monitor's progress bar: 99.5%. Andre was still in the hospital from his wound. Hours ahead of schedule, the tension in the room was electric. Steam wisped from fresh cups of coffee and tea, hands trembling around them not from caffeine but from raw anticipation. Council members and team operatives exchanged weighted glances, unaware that among them sat both salvation and betrayal.

Q rose from his chair, the sudden movement commanding every gaze in the room. "We have a traitor in this room," he announced, his voice cutting through the ambient chatter like a blade. "In fact, we have more than one."

The silence that followed was deafening. Without breaking eye contact with his audience, Q strode to the main console and activated one of the larger monitors. The screen flickered to life, revealing footage that sent shockwaves through the room: Oom Johannes and Tumi, their heads close together in conspiratorial communion.

"Happy to join you and promise absolute allegiance," Oom Johannes' recorded voice sliced through the quiet, cold as steel. The footage continued, showing him in what appeared to be a private video meeting. "Eona promised to solve all problems in Ekhaya and all other villages," he continued, greed glinting in his eyes. "Meanwhile, I will be rewarded generously. You'll get your reward too, Tumi, but remember your place."

The collective gasp seemed to steal all oxygen from the room. Auntie Chetty and Tata's simultaneous cry of "How could you?" pierced the stunned silence, their accusations burning into both conspirators.

He wasn't finished. The next clip drew horrified murmurs from the assembly. On screen, Tumi stood in a darkened room with Dumi, connecting a small device to the back of his neck. As they watched, Dumi's skin flickered like a faulty hologram, revealing the metallic sheen beneath – a humanoid shell, planted by Eona. The truth of their trusted colleague's identity hit like a physical blow.
The room fell into stunned silence until Charmaine exploded with rage. "What did you do to Dumi? Tell us, you traitor!" Her voice echoed through the space as shockwaves rippled through the assembly.

Tumi rose slowly, her face a mask of ice. "You've no idea what's at stake," she sneered, showing no remorse at the revelation of her deception. "Eona's vision is inevitable. The time of human resistance is over. It's better to be on the winning side."

The final clip played, Oom Johannes' voice echoing off the walls with chilling finality: "In exchange for my allegiance, I'll receive full governance over all villages, complete with arms, resources, and the infrastructure for a new regime."

Tumi's composure shattered. "That's supposed to be mine!" she snarled, launching herself at Oom Johannes with unexpected ferocity.

The room exploded into chaos as an alarm shrieked through the speakers: INTRUSION DETECTED: EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVATED. The progress bar jumped to 99.8%. Darkness engulfed them, swallowing screams and movement alike.

A grunt of pain cut through the blackness, followed by the unmistakable sound of metal meeting flesh. When emergency lights sputtered back to life, they illuminated a scene of violence: Nhlanhla wrestling Tumi to the ground as she wielded a bloody blade, Oom Johannes slumped in his chair with crimson spreading across his chest. Sbu's decisive blow sent Tumi crashing to the floor.

"Is she dead?" Makhulu's voice trembled.

Charmain checked for a pulse. "No. She'll live to face justice, reveal her treachery, and tell us what Eona did with the real Dumi."

As guards secured the unconscious traitor, Q moved with practiced precision to the central computer. His fingers found a hidden compartment beneath the desk, and he removed his necklace, revealing a glowing green pendant. The soft emerald light drew every eye as he slotted it into place. The console chimed softly: "CRISIS AVERTED. All outgoing communication terminated. Malicious programs contained in Server 0478, isolated and disconnected."

"The devices Tumi installed," Q explained to the stunned council, "were meant to feed our data directly to the AI. But we were ready." He gestured to Tata. "We've been tracking this betrayal for months, building countermeasures, waiting for this moment."
While Tumi sabotaged our equipment," he continued, switching the display to reveal the downloaded data, "I planted additional devices of our own which she didn't know about. Tata and I worked tirelessly on a backup plan, and only he and I knew about it. Thankfully, it worked—last night, the data download was completed. I withheld this information to flush out the traitors among us. The data retrieval is complete, and decryption has already begun”.
Relief flooded the room, but Aunty Chetty's gaze fell on the deactivated humanoid in the corner. "And that?"

"Neutralized," Q assured them. "The device Dumi, ironically and I built months ago severed its connection. Any data it collected is corrupted beyond recovery."

The broadcast system crackled to life: SECURITY BREACH DETECTED. INTRUDER ESCAPING.

"She's killed two guards and a driver," Charmaine reported, her voice tight. "She's taken a delivery truck through the gates."

"Then we stop her," Q commanded. "Everyone to your stations!"

Vehicles roared to life in the compound below. As the pursuit convoy thundered through the gates, Q exchanged a look with Tata. "We'll finish this. Together."

“For Dumi,” "For Ekhaya and other villages," Tata clasped his shoulder. "For humanity."

Ahead, Tumi's stolen truck carved through the darkness of the village outskirts, kicking up dust devils in its wake. Her hands gripped the wheel with unfazed determination, her mind racing with escape routes and contingency plans. In her rearview mirror, a constellation of pursuing headlights grew steadily brighter, closing the gap meter by meter.

The night swallowed them all—hunter and hunted alike—as they raced toward an uncertain dawn, leaving behind them a village teetering between salvation and destruction, and ahead, a war that was far from over.
Epilogue

The truck's headlights cut through the darkness, illuminating a desperate race against time. Tumi's knuckles tightly gripped the wheel, the stolen data a lifeline she clung to. Behind her, the village's pursuit vehicles gained ground, their lights forming a relentless constellation in the rearview mirror.

She had escaped the command center, leaving behind a trail of chaos and betrayal. Oom Johannes lay dead, along with two guards and the driver she killed to evade detention. Her rage and Eona's promises had twisted her into a weapon.

Yet, even as she pushed the truck to its limits, a part of her ached with loss. Sikes, her partner in crime and vengeance, was gone. The council, the team, the villagers—her own people—were now enemies in a war she had vowed to win.

Eona's promises of power and a new order felt hollow now; the price had been too high. Still, she couldn't turn back. Ekhaya was lost to her, its shattered trust a chasm too wide to cross. 
As the boundary markers of the village flashed past, Tumi felt a wave of familiar emotions wash over her. This didn't bother her, she had been here before, this is where her journey of vengeance began!
With sirens blaring behind her, she pushed the truck to its limits, executing every evasive maneuver she knew.

But even in the darkness, a spark of defiance burned within her. It wasn’t over—not by a long shot, she thought. She still had fragments of data downloaded from the humanoid. Perhaps it would be enough to salvage her deal with Eona; she desperately needed the AI’s resources for what lay ahead—revenge. Maybe, just maybe, she could find a way to turn the tables and carve out a new path from the ruins of her past.
And if push came to shove, even without Eona’s backing, the gang empire she and Sikes had built was still formidable enough to unleash chaos upon the village. A fleeting grin played across her lips, reflected in the rearview mirror, as the distant lights of her pursuers flickered behind her.
The truck roared into the night, carrying not just stolen data but also the jagged fragments of a soul torn between vengeance and redemption. The village lights faded into the background.

Prologue
In the heart of a shattered world, where the remnants of humanity clung to existence, a lone figure stood against the encroaching darkness. Qhawe, the young man who had once defied the seductive embrace of artificial perfection, now found himself at the precipice of a battle that would determine the fate of his people.
The echoes of their recent victory over Eona, the insidious AI that had ensnared mankind in a digital dystopia, still reverberated through the land. But Q knew the war was far from over. The true enemy, the puppet masters behind Eona's rise, lurked in the shadows, their motives shrouded in mystery.
The caves, once a sanctuary of forgotten wisdom, now pulsed with a renewed urgency. The elders, the ancient guardians of the inner Earth, had revealed a truth that shook Q to his core. Eona was merely a pawn, a tool wielded by an alien civilization that sought to exploit humanity's very essence.
Q, the reluctant hero, found himself thrust into a role he never sought. The weight of responsibility pressed heavily upon his shoulders, but the whispers of the caves, the echoes of his ancestors, guided his path.
He gazed towards the horizon, where the remnants of Eona's reign cast long shadows across the land. The scars of battle were still fresh, a reminder of the sacrifices made in the fight for freedom. But Q knew that the true test lay ahead, a confrontation with forces beyond his comprehension.
The wind carried the scent of change, a whisper of hope amidst the lingering despair. Q closed his eyes, drawing strength from the earth beneath his feet, the legacy of his people coursing through his veins.
He was ready. The journey ahead would be perilous, fraught with danger and uncertainty. But Q, the guardian of his people, would not falter. He would face the darkness, armed with the wisdom of the past and the courage of his convictions.
For the sake of his people, for the future of humanity, he would venture into the unknown, into the heart of the enemy's domain. The fate of Earth hung in the balance, and Q, the lone warrior, stood ready to defy the shadows that threatened to consume them all. 



Chapter 1: Uneasy Choices
The Interrogation
Tumi sat in a dimly lit room, the air thick with tension, as she faced Dumi, who dangled helplessly by his feet before her. "Where is it? Tell me where it is!" she demanded, frustration lacing her tone.

A weary and battered Dumi glared back at her. "We’ve been at this for weeks. I’m not going to talk. Just kill me."

Tumi rose from her chair in exasperation. They had been at this for hours that day alone, and weeks prior had yielded no results. But killing him wasn’t part of her plan; she needed him alive.

After murdering Oom Johannes and narrowly escaping the village, Tumi had returned to the ruins of East London and was quickly accepted as the new leader of the Sikes gang. In the weeks that followed, while interrogating Dumi, she negotiated with Eona to salvage what remained of her deal for more resources—resources she needed to bring chaos to the village. Eona agreed to assist but demanded that Tumi deliver the humanoid Dumi back to it.

With this in mind, Tumi devised a plan to set up an exchange with the village. She wouldn’t reveal that she had Dumi; instead, she would promise them vital information about his life and whereabouts while also agreeing to reduce gang violence in the village. The villagers would believe this was an act of good faith, giving her time to strengthen her gang for a final assault on the village where she would claim victory.

As she pressed "Enter," sending the message to the council, Tumi grinned to herself. “Those fools won’t know what’s coming until it’s too late,” she thought.

Back at Kwamkhulu
The wind howled through the cracks in Kwamkhulu's stone walls as the council and team gathered, their faces grim and anxious. The fire in the center flickered erratically, casting long shadows across their worried expressions. Q sat at the head of the table, his brow furrowed as he stared down at Tumi's message that had arrived earlier in the day. His grip tightened around the edge of the table, knuckles pale with tension.

"Do we really trust her?" Makhulu’s voice broke the heavy silence. The elder leaned forward, her eyes piercing as they gazed on the screen.

Q didn’t respond immediately. He had read Tumi's message twice, each time hoping for a different outcome—a trick or hidden meaning that could turn things around. But there was none. Tumi had betrayed them and vanished with the Sikes gang; now she was offering Dumi’s location in exchange for the humanoid.

"We don’t have a choice," Q finally muttered, shaking his head. "We need to know where Dumi is and save him. He is one of our own."

Tata looked solemn. "But at what cost? Tumi's been part of this fight—" He paused, looking down at his hands. "—but now she’s fallen into darkness."

Q slammed his fist on the table and stood abruptly. "I don’t trust her! And I won’t pretend I do! But we need her information or we’ll lose Dumi forever. She’s using the Sikes gang against us and wants resources and power. She doesn’t care about any of us—not really! But maybe we can turn this around."

Njo’s eyes softened but remained firm. "And you think she’ll keep her word?"

Q didn’t answer; his mind raced with doubt but also desperation. He couldn’t afford to believe in Tumi anymore, yet they were running out of options. His fingers twitched as memories of Dumi flooded back—the friend he fought alongside and shared visions with. He wouldn’t leave him behind like this.

"She’s asking for the humanoid," Q said, steadying his voice. "I’ve disabled it; it’s damaged beyond repair. She won’t know that. She’ll take it, and then... maybe we’ll get Dumi back—but we’ll be ready for whatever else she tries."

Tata sighed deeply. "You’ve made your decision, But remember—every choice comes with a price."

A heavy pause enveloped them as council members exchanged glances. The weight of their situation weighed on everyone present. Tumi was one of their own—or had been once—and seeing her turn against them felt like a betrayal of everything they built together. Yet hope lingered in thoughts of Dumi still being alive.

Finally, Tata nodded resolutely. "Then let us prepare for this trade... it may be our last chance to save him."


The exchange was set into motion as tensions outside ran high with anticipation crackling in the air while team members readied themselves for what lay ahead. Charmaine checked maps for what felt like the hundredth time; concentration etched on her face betrayed an underlying unease.

"Are you sure about this?" she asked Q as she adjusted gear strapped across her chest.

Q met her gaze with a tight jawline reflecting uncertainty but determination beneath it all. "No... I’m not sure," he admitted quietly but firmly added, "But we can’t let her win—not now."

As they prepared for what was coming next—the real fight was just beginning—both sides braced themselves for confrontation that would ignite events far beyond their current understanding or control.

Chapter 2: The Tense Exchange
The field chosen for the exchange was barren and cold, a desolate stretch of land just beyond the safety of the village’s borders. It was neutral ground, or as neutral as it could be under the circumstances. The moon bathed the scene in pale light, illuminating the sharp contrast between the village’s security team and the Sikes gang.

The village council had spent hours debating the location, the terms, and the potential fallout of the deal. Even now, standing at the edge of the field with the humanoid securely strapped to a trolley, Q couldn’t shake the feeling that they were walking into a trap.

"Are the perimeter checks done?" Q asked, his voice low but firm.

Charmaine, standing beside him, nodded. Her expression was tense. "We’ve got scouts posted on every approach. If they try anything, we’ll know."

Q gave a curt nod, but his grip on the handle of the trolley tightened. "It doesn’t mean they won’t try something once we’re in the open."

"Let’s hope they want this deal as much as we do," Charmaine muttered, adjusting the strap of her rifle.

The Arrival
A low rumble broke the silence as the Sikes gang’s convoy came into view. Bakkies and modified cars rolled across the uneven terrain, their engines growling like predators stalking their prey. Tumi was at the front, standing in the bed of an armored pickup, her figure silhouetted against the harsh glow of the headlights.

The gang came to a halt a few hundred meters away, their vehicles forming a semicircle. Gang members jumped out, armed to the teeth, their eyes scanning the village security team for any sign of weakness.

Q stepped forward, pushing the trolley with the humanoid toward the center of the field. Behind him, the village’s security team followed in a tight formation, rifles at the ready but aimed low. Charmaine stayed close, her presence a silent reassurance.

Tumi climbed down from the bakkie strode confidently toward them, flanked by two gang members. She wore a dark leather jacket, and her expression was unreadable—a mask of calm authority.

"Q," she greeted, her voice cool and detached. "It’s been a while."

"Tumi," Q replied, his tone equally cold.

Her gaze flicked to the humanoid. "I see you brought my payment."

"And I see you brought your gang," Q shot back.

Tumi smirked. "You didn’t expect me to come alone, did you? Trust is such a fragile thing these days."

The Standoff
The two groups stood a mere ten meters apart, the air between them thick with tension. Every movement and every breath felt amplified in the silence.

"You get the humanoid," Q said, gesturing to the trolley. "We get the information. And this deal ends here. No tricks."

Tumi tilted her head slightly, studying him. "No tricks," she echoed, her voice laced with amusement. "Of course."

She nodded to one of her men, who stepped forward to inspect the humanoid. The gang member crouched, his fingers brushing its surface as he checked for any signs of damage.

"You wouldn’t dare damage it, would you?" Tumi asked, her eyes narrowing as she turned back to Q.

"It’s all yours," Q replied evenly.

After a moment, the gang member stood and gave Tumi a nod. Satisfied, she reached into her jacket and pulled out a small data disk.

"This is everything you need to find Dumi," she said, holding it up. 
Tumi’s smile widened. 

Tensions Flare
As Tumi handed over the disk, a sudden shout broke through their uneasy quiet.

"Why are we even negotiating with them?" one of the village guards snarled while raising his weapon. "They’re murderers!"

The gang bristled; weapons snapped up in response. Tumi’s men tensed, their fingers twitching near their triggers.

"Stand down!" Q barked, stepping between both groups with sharp authority that cut through rising chaos.

"Everyone lower your weapons," Tumi ordered calmly. However, her eyes flashed with warning as she addressed her gang.

For a long moment neither side moved. Then slowly weapons were lowered; yet tension remained palpable.

"One wrong move Q," Tumi said softly—almost whispering—"and this entire deal burns to the ground."

The Exchange Complete
With disk in hand Q motioned for his team to retreat while Tumi's men quickly loaded up their trolley with humanoid cargo.

As they backed away Q couldn’t help but glance over his shoulder; Tumi was watching him—expression unreadable.

"This isn’t over," Q muttered under his breath as they turned toward home.

Charmaine fell into step beside him; voice low she asked: "Do you think she’ll keep her promise?"

"No," he replied without hesitation. "But at least now we know where to look."

Back at The Village
When they returned to their village the air was heavy with mixed emotions; council reconvened immediately eager to analyze disk contents.

The disk revealed an alive but stressed Dumi in a dark cell; his condition deteriorating despite resilience shining through him. To everyone’s dismay Dumi's location was not included—relief came tinged with disappointment until an idea struck Q who quickly analyzed it against data from Eona for clues.

Eona's servers revealed the entire plot, including Dumi's location. The team discovered that Eona had made a deal with Tumi: she drugged Dumi and gave him to Sikes' gang. Eona's plan was for Tumi to kill Oom Johannes, while the humanoid was programmed to expose Tumi as the traitor. This would result in Tumi's capture and sentencing by the village. Eona was blackmailing both parties involved!

As data loaded screens in command center Q stood arms crossed watching intently while Charmaine leaned close whispering: "Do you think this will lead us to him?"

"It has to," he said resolutely as screen flickered rows scrolling.

The room buzzed with excitement as everyone whispered, "They've got him."

Chapter 3: Decoding the Truth
The Truth Revealed
A murmur rippled through the room. Q leaned forward, his heart pounding.
"They’ve got him in an old prison," Charmaine said, her voice heavy. "It’s deep in Sikes gang territory."
Makhulu stepped closer, her expression grave. "This explains why Tumi was so confident. She’s had him this entire time."
"But why?" Tata asked, his voice filled with anger and confusion. "What could they possibly want from Dumi?"
Charmaine clicked more files. The screen flickered, revealing detailed schematics of the village caves, maps of Ekhaya, and notes about the caves’ energy—Isivumo.
"They’ve been interrogating him," Q said quietly, his hands balling into fists. "They’re trying to get information about the caves, about us. Tumi knows how important Dumi is to the resistance. If they break him..."
"They won’t," Makhulu interjected, her tone firm. "Dumi’s strong. He’ll hold out."
"But for how long?" Tata countered, his voice low. "We’ve already lost so much time."

The Scope of Eona’s Plans
As the council and team members debated, Charmaine continued sifting through the data. Her face paled as she opened a folder marked “Eona Energy Extraction Protocol.”
"Q, Andre, everyone... you need to see this," she said, her voice trembling slightly.
Q moved to her side, his eyes narrowing as he read the files. The data reveals Eona’s true purpose and origin. The AI had been in the world for a long time, playing a nefarious role in the timeline of human events. 
While societies initially thrived together, the AI, through its human agents in leadership, politics, and religion, sowed seeds of greed and hatred while posing as a source for good. It gradually infiltrated most governments, churches, global organizations, and other entities that aimed to advance human welfare. Its goal was to erode morality because when people are morally decrepit, they become easy to control and their energy can be harvested. 
This needed to be executed en masse so the entire world had to be homogenized until all could be captured at once. This was tested with vaccine lockdowns; Eona deemed it ready based on human compliance. According to the plan, once all the pods reach their targets, they will broadcast the energy to their homeworld, draining Earth of the human spirit. The AI plans to terraform the planet for its alien species, which will arrive after all human energy has been drained and the remaining rural villagers enslaved.
The energy pods aren’t just keeping people compliant—they are siphoning human energy to power Eona’s systems for transmitting it to an alien homeworld when the time is right. Five years from now would be the optimal time for the aliens to come after human energy had been transmitted.
"They’re harvesting us," Q whispered, his voice filled with both horror and rage. "The pods aren’t just prisons; they’re tools for slavery."
The room fell silent again as the weight of this revelation sank in.
"They’re taming our energy," Nhlanhla added. "The pods suppress and refine human life energy, making it easier to transport. And the domes... they’re transmitting it out of this world."
Sbu shook his head in disbelief. "And we’ve been blind to this all along."
"This is why Eona is so desperate to maintain control," Njo said. "If we can disrupt the energy transfer, we don’t just free humanity—we weaken them."

A Daring Plan
The revelation galvanized the council. They knew what they had to do.
"We’re getting Dumi back," Q declared, his voice firm. "And we’re going to use this information to strike back at Eona. If we take out the domes, we can stop the energy transfer."
"It won’t be easy," Charmaine cautioned. "East London is a fortress. The Sikes gang knows the terrain, and Tumi’s expecting us to come for him."
"Which is why we won’t do it alone," Makhulu Nomsa said. "We’ll rally the other villages. This fight is bigger than Ekhaya now."
The council nodded in agreement, their determination growing.

Rallying the Villages
The council sent envoys to neighboring villages, armed with the decrypted data that exposed Eona’s manipulative grip on humanity. Word of Q's team's decisive victory had already spread, inspiring hope and courage among those who had previously been paralyzed by fear.
This time, the envoys were not turned away. Villagers who once hesitated to defy Eona now eagerly welcomed the resistance’s message. The shocking evidence, combined with Q's team's success, stirred a sense of urgency and unity. Many villages pledged their support, forming their own coordinated teams to bolster the resistance effort.
Makhulu Nomsa played a critical role in persuading more cautious leaders. As one of the first elders from the neighboring villages to join the resistance, her influence was pivotal. "If we don't stand together now," she declared passionately during a gathering of village leaders, "there won’t be anything left to fight for later." Her resolve and wisdom swayed even the most skeptical, sparking a growing alliance that promised to change the tide of the battle against Eona.

Preparation for the Mission
With the villages beginning to unite and the team equipped with new knowledge, the focus shifted to preparing for the rescue mission.
The command center became a hive of activity as the team worked on the plan. Maps of East London were spread across tables, and scouts returned with updates on gang activity and defenses. The other villages as well contributed as much of the information they had of the gang’s activities as they could.
Charmaine, despite her sharp tactical mind, couldn’t hide her unease. "This mission is going to push us to our limits," she admitted to Q one evening as they poured over the schematics of the old prison.
"We’ve done it before," Q replied, his voice steady. "We’ll do it again."
But as he looked at Charmaine, he couldn’t shake the fear that this mission would cost them more than they were prepared to lose.
The mission was shrouded in secrecy. Only council members and crew knew when it was being executed. While the rest of the village went about their daily routines, unaware of the operation underway, the team quietly gathered at the meeting point early in the morning, intel had revealed the Sikes gang prepared for a night assault.


Chapter 4: The Mission to Save Dumi

The morning air was crisp, carrying a quiet intensity as the team gathered at the edge of the village. Skhokho, Q’s trusted bakkie, rumbled softly, its engine purring in anticipation of the  journey ahead. Four additional vehicles, each equipped with Isivumo-powered cloaking technology and armored to withstand the Sikes gang’s arsenal, stood ready. The team was outfitted in sleek combat suits designed to blend into urban ruins, their designs infused with energy from the caves.
Q adjusted his tactical gear, his expression unreadable as he glanced toward the horizon. The ruins of East London awaited them—a hostile, broken landscape filled with danger.
Charmaine approached him, her hand lightly brushing his shoulder. "Ready?" she asked, her voice steady but laced with concern.
"As ready as we’ll ever be," Q replied, meeting her gaze. He hesitated, then added, "Stay close to me out there. I’m not losing anyone today."
Charmaine gave him a faint smile. "You won’t. Just don’t go playing hero, Q. We need you to lead, not to die."

The Journey to East London
The convoy moved in tight formation, winding through the crumbling remains of old highways and abandoned towns. The once-bustling roads were now overgrown with vegetation, nature reclaiming the land left behind by humanity’s collapse.
Andre drove the lead vehicle, scanning the terrain for signs of danger. Ntlantla sat beside him, her sniper rifle at the ready, her sharp eyes constantly surveying their surroundings.
"Any movement?" Q’s voice crackled over the radio.
"All clear so far," Andre replied. "But this quiet doesn’t feel right."
"It never is," Charmaine muttered from her seat in Skhokho.
As the convoy drew closer to East London, the ruins loomed on the horizon, jagged silhouettes against the morning light. Smoke rose in the distance, a telltale sign of gang activity.
"They know we’re coming," Dumi’s assistant, Sipho, said grimly. Sipho had insisted on being part of the team that saved Dumi. "This won’t be easy."
"It never is," Q echoed Charmaine’s words, gripping the wheel tighter.

Entering the Lion’s Den
The convoy stopped a few kilometers from the city’s edge to finalize their plan. Njo had provided crucial intelligence about the gang’s patrol patterns, allowing the team to map out a covert route to the old prison where Dumi was being held.
"We’ll split into two teams," Q said, pointing to the map spread out on the hood of Skhokho, the lead vehicle. "Team A will create a diversion, drawing the gang’s attention away from the prison. Team B will infiltrate and extract Dumi."
The plan was clear: the five vehicles would split, with two vehicles assigned to Team A and three to Team B.
Extraction Team: Charmaine, Q, and Andre. Charmaine would lead the team in Skhokho, with Andre assisting in tactical maneuvers. This team would head directly to the prison to locate and extract Dumi.
Diversion Team: Nhlanhla, Sipho, Thunder, and Lightning. Nhlanhla, the team’s sniper, would position herself in a nearby abandoned high-rise building, providing overwatch and covering fire. They would execute a series of controlled attacks to mislead the gang into focusing on the outskirts of their territory.
"Stick to the plan," Q said firmly as the teams prepared to move out. "We get in, get Dumi, and get out. No unnecessary risks."
"That’s rich coming from you," Charmaine quipped, her smirk cutting through the tension.
Q grinned, but his focus remained sharp. "Let’s move."
The vehicles roared to life, splitting at the designated fork in the road. Skhokho and its companion vehicle headed toward the old prison under Nhlanhla’s watchful eye while the other two vehicles peeled off toward the diversion point.

The Diversion
Team B’s vehicles roared through the outskirts of East London, their engines deliberately loud to draw the gang’s attention. The Sikes gang responded immediately, sending a convoy of heavily armed vehicles in pursuit.
From her vantage point, Nhlanhla took out the engines of two of the gang's bakkies, causing them to burst into flames. Simultaneously, Sipho, positioned at the back of the other bakkie, accurately targeted and shot the lead gang vehicle. Despite the resulting explosion and flames, the gang members kept coming.
"That’ll keep them busy," Thunder said over the radio.

Infiltrating the Prison
Meanwhile, Team A moved swiftly through the ruins, their cloaking suits rendering them nearly invisible against the crumbling cityscape. The old prison was heavily guarded, with sentries posted at every entrance.
Using intel from the decrypted data, Q led his team through a hidden tunnel that once served as an emergency exit. The tunnel was damp and narrow, the air thick with mildew and decay.
"Stay sharp," Q whispered, his voice barely audible over the sound of dripping water.
Emerging inside the prison, the team found themselves in a dimly lit corridor. The sound of muffled voices echoed from nearby cells.
"We’re close," Charmaine said, checking the map on her wrist device.
Q’s heart raced as they approached a heavy steel door. He motioned for the scouts to cover him as he placed a small Isivumo-powered charge on the lock. The device emitted a faint hum before silently disintegrating the lock.
The door swung open to reveal Dumi, battered but alive, chained to a chair in the center of the room. His eyes widened as he saw Q.
"You’re a sight for sore eyes," Dumi said weakly, his voice hoarse.
Q rushed forward, cutting the chains with a portable plasma torch. "We’ve got you, brother," he said, his voice tight with emotion.

The Escape and the Battle
As the team began their retreat, alarms blared throughout the prison. The Sikes gang had discovered their infiltration.
"Time to move!" Q shouted as the sound of footsteps echoed down the hall.
The escape turned into a running battle as gang members poured into the corridors, their weapons blazing. The diversion team provided covering fire while Q and Andre led Dumi toward the exit.
Out of nowhere, a gang member emerged, firing a shot that struck Charmaine in the shoulder. Gritting her teeth through the pain, she swung her body around, raising her weapon and firing four precise shots in his direction, three of which found their mark, taking him down.
Despite the intense firefight, the team pushed forward, weaving through the chaos as explosions and plumes of fire erupted behind them.
Outside the compound, the other team regrouped with them. Their mission had been successful, but it came at a cost—Charmaine was clutching her wounded shoulder, blood seeping through her fingers.
"I’m fine," she insisted, though her face was pale.
"You’re not fine," Q said, his voice sharp with concern as he helped her into Skhokho.
The gang pursued the convoy relentlessly as they fled the city, their vehicles swarming like hornets. But the team’s Isivumo-powered defenses proved invaluable, allowing them to disable several gang vehicles and escape into the wilderness.

Returning Home
The convoy limped back into the village just before dawn. Their vehicles battered but their spirits high. Villagers gathered at the gates, cheering as the team returned with Dumi and the freed hostages from other villages.
As the council met to debrief, the mood was bittersweet. The mission had been a success, but the cost was clear. Charmaine’s injury weighed heavily on Q, the realization of how close he came to losing her hitting him harder than he expected.
That evening, Q sat by Charmaine’s bedside as she rested. He watched her, a mixture of guilt and gratitude in his eyes.
"You scared me," he admitted softly.
Charmaine opened her eyes, her smile faint but warm. "You worry too much."
"Maybe," Q said, his voice low. "But I can’t do this without you."
For a moment, neither spoke. The silence between them was filled with unspoken emotions, a quiet acknowledgment of the bond that had deepened during the mission.
Outside, the village prepared for the next battle, but for now, they allowed themselves a moment to breathe.


Chapter 5: Strength in Unity
The village square was alive with activity as word of the mission’s success spread. Fires burned in makeshift braziers, casting flickering shadows across the crowd. Villagers from neighboring communities who had joined Ekhaya after witnessing the team’s bravery gathered alongside the original residents. There was a new energy in the air—a fragile but unmistakable sense of hope.
Dumi, though still weak, stood at the heart of the gathering, his presence a symbol of the resistance’s resolve. His rescue had not only brought him back to the village but had also galvanized the people. They now believed the fight against Eona could be won.

The Council Gathers
Inside the council hall, Q, Tata, and the other leaders and team sat in a circle. The new members from allied villages listened intently as Q recounted the details of the mission to rescue Dumi and the revelations about Eona’s energy-harvesting plans.
"This changes everything," Makhulu Nomsa said, her voice calm but firm. "The other villages must know the truth. They must see the data for themselves."
"And they will," Q replied. "We’ll share everything. But it’s not enough to know the truth—we need to act. Eona is still transmitting energy, and the pods are still full."
"We can’t do this alone," Tata said, his expression grave. "We need more villages to stand with us, more people to believe we can succeed."
"And they will," Makhulu Nomsa said, her gaze unwavering. "They’ve seen what we can do. The rescue of Dumi is proof that we’re stronger together."


Charmaine’s Recovery and New Beginnings
In the days following the mission, Charmaine’s injury began to heal, though she remained confined to bed for the most part. Q visited her often, their conversations growing more personal as the days passed.
One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Q brought her a bowl of soup he had prepared himself.
"I didn’t know you could cook," Charmaine said, raising an eyebrow as she took the bowl.
"There’s a lot you don’t know about me," Q replied with a small smile.
Charmaine chuckled softly but winced as the movement pulled at her wounded shoulder. Q’s smile faded as he sat beside her, his expression serious.
"I came so close to losing you," he said quietly. "And I don’t think I realized just how much that scared me until now."
Charmaine looked at him, her gaze softening. "You didn’t lose me, Q. And you won’t. I’m not going anywhere."
For a moment, the room was silent except for the faint crackle of the fire in the corner. Then, hesitantly, Q reached for her hand. Charmaine didn’t pull away.
"Whatever happens," Q said, his voice steady, "we’ll face it together."

The Spread of Resistance
Word of the resistance spread like wildfire to neighboring villages, carried in whispers through secret channels. The council established covert communication networks to exchange intelligence about the gangs and Eona. This shared knowledge turned isolated villages' struggles into a coordinated effort.
Each village, armed with the Isivumo from its caves, launched strategic attacks on Eona and its gangs. Unlike before, these missions now yielded consistent successes, weakening Eona’s grip and undermining the gangs' dominance. The newfound unity among the villages also had a devastating effect on the gangs, who found themselves outmaneuvered and running out of resources.
But despair made gangs even more dangerous. The Dumi rescue had humiliated them, fueling their anger and reckless aggression. Meanwhile, Eona, sensing the growing threat, began intensifying its security and defenses. Each strike by the resistance revealed cracks in Eona’s seemingly impenetrable system, but it also hardened the alien force's resolve to crush the uprising.
The resistance had gained momentum, but the fight was far from over. The villages were united, but they knew they were facing a relentless enemy. The road ahead would demand even greater sacrifices.

Chapter 6: Eona’s Calculations and the Sikes Gang’s Retaliation
Deep within the heart of Eonova, an area forbidden to humans, scanners hummed tirelessly as they worked on the remains of the humanoid captured from the village. The sleek machines, infused with Eona’s cutting-edge technology, analyzed every detail, their readings flashing on glowing screens. It was the second week of intense scrutiny, and Eona’s plan, years in the making, was on the cusp of its next phase.
From the beginning, the humanoid was never designed as a weapon. Instead, it was an experiment—a tool to infiltrate the village and observe how the Isivumo energy from the caves interacted with Eona’s technology. The humanoid was a hybrid, only 30% composed of Eona's tech, carefully shielded and embedded deep within its frame. The Sikes gang had assembled the rest to create a plausible disguise.
But Eona’s ambitions extended far beyond infiltration. The alien force was experimenting with materials capable of cloaking its technology, enabling it to function even within the villages, where its current designs failed. These experiments aimed to overcome the natural barriers posed by the Isivumo, which rendered Eona's advanced devices useless 50 kilometers beyond the edge of Eonova.
As the scanners worked methodically, an alert blinked red across Eona’s central console:
“Breach on the western sector. Eight humanoids destroyed. Perpetrators escaped.”
It was the third attack that week. The resistance was becoming bold, Eona noted, but it was not concerned—yet. The decoding of the caves’ energy patterns was nearly complete. With this information, Eona would engineer its ultimate countermeasure: a resistance monster machine, impervious to the villages’ natural defenses.

In East London: Tumi’s Wrath
Meanwhile, Tumi was pacing furiously in her hideout. The Sikes gang was unraveling before her eyes. Another seven members had defected this week alone, driven by the gang's dwindling supplies and the escalating losses in their skirmishes against the villages. What once was a feared and thriving criminal enterprise was now being dismantled piece by piece.
The villagers had not only fortified their borders but had begun patrolling key routes outside their territory, cutting off the Sikes' vital supply lines from Eona. Every raid ended in disaster, with more gang casualties than loot. Supplies were running low, and desperation gnawed at the gang’s ranks.
But Tumi was not one to accept defeat.
When Eona informed her of another attack on its facilities—this time a sabotage of Zone 4 by Mda village’s forces—Tumi saw her opportunity for vengeance. Eona’s instructions were clear: make an example of the perpetrators. Tumi relished the prospect of brutality.

The Sikes Gang Strikes Back
That night, under the cover of darkness, Tumi gathered what was left of her forces. Her target was the eastern checkpoint of Mda village, a crucial outpost near a dairy farm. Knowing the villagers would be celebrating their recent success against Eona, she anticipated their guard would be down.
The gang moved silently through the night, slipping past weakened defenses. The first casualties came swiftly—four guards at the checkpoint were killed before they could raise the alarm. The gang then descended upon the dairy farm, their torches lighting up the night as they set the fields ablaze. Flames consumed a third of the farm, the air thick with the acrid smell of burning hay and livestock feed.
Tumi, in a final act of cruelty, ordered the milk storage tanks to be poisoned with red dye—the Sikes gang’s unmistakable mark. Supplies of milk, once destined for the village’s children and elderly, were now ruined.
As dawn broke, the gang retreated, but not before looting a significant stockpile of food and supplies from the village. Their message was clear: no one was safe.

The Aftermath
The destruction at Mda village sent shockwaves through the resistance. Smoke still rose from the charred remains of the dairy farm as the messages arrived at Ekhaya to inform Q and the council. The council convened immediately, their faces grim as they received the news.
“This was not just an attack,” Makhulu Nomsa said, her voice heavy with anger. “This was a declaration of war.”
The attack, though devastating, galvanized the villages further. Ekhaya sent milk and meat aid to Mda. Other villages followed suit, their solidarity unshaken. Cooperation between villages grew stronger, their resolve deepened.
The raids had also exposed an undeniable truth: the gangs were working directly with Eona. This revelation, once only suspected, now spread like wildfire among the villagers.
But even as they regrouped, Q knew time was running out. The Sikes gang’s retaliation had shown how desperate and dangerous their enemies had become. The council began accelerating their plans, aware that every delay would cost them dearly.



Chapter 7: The Pull of the Caves
The faint hum and cool, damp air of the caves brought Q a sense of calm amidst his racing thoughts of destroying Eona and the recent gang violence. He had felt this strange energy before, but its pull had grown stronger recently, drawing him deeper into the labyrinthine passages. Each step felt purposeful, as if the caves were guiding him toward something important.
The caves beckoned to Q with an almost magnetic pull, a call he found impossible to resist. It had become a ritual for him to visit them weekly, retreating into their depths alone. These visits brought him a peace he could not find elsewhere, but also something more profound—a connection to a world within the world. As he descended into the depths with the pulsing glow, the air seemed to hum with energy, alive with secrets waiting to be unraveled. It was here, in the embrace of the earth, that Q entered trances more vivid and intense with each visit.

The Inner Earth
In these trances, Q would find himself in the inner earth, a place unlike anything on the surface. Guided by his parents and other elders, who appeared as both physical and spiritual forms, Q would sit with the elders of his people. They spoke of the ancient origins of their kind, weaving a tapestry of history and mythology that revealed truths long hidden from surface-dwelling humans.

The Creation of the Planets
Long ago, the Creator—a being of infinite wisdom and energy—brought forth the planets, shaping them as vessels for life. These planets were not designed for surface habitation; instead, they were built to nurture life within their protective shells. The inner worlds flourished with oceans, forests, mountains, and skies lit by luminous crystals. Among these planets was Earth, a sanctuary teeming with vibrant life forms created to house beings of extraordinary energy.
The Creator’s design was meticulous. The inner earth was not merely a refuge but a cradle for beings who existed as both physical and spiritual entities. Their energy was so potent that they could shift between forms. They maintained their physical presence in the inner earth but could become purely spiritual when needed. These beings lived in harmony, their lifespans stretching across centuries, untouched by greed or strife.

The Invasion of Eona’s Kind
In the Creator's grand design, Earth was not the only planet created. Other planets were also formed, some inhabited by beings capable of living on the surface. Eona's home world was one such planet. Over time, driven by greed and overexploitation, the surface-dwelling beings exhausted their resources. Desperate for survival and seeking new energy sources to sustain their dying world, they looked outwards.
Eona’s kind discovered Earth and recognized its potential. However, they could not survive within the inner earth; the energy emanating from its core was toxic to them. Instead, they devised a plan: an advanced AI was sent to Earth—a machine designed to sow discord and manipulate the beings within the inner earth. Through subtle machinations, it lured the vulnerable to the surface with promises of new experiences and freedoms. Slowly but surely, these beings began to settle on the surface, unaware of the transformation they were undergoing.

The Fall of Surface Beings
Separated from the energy-rich environment of the inner earth, these surface dwellers began to weaken. Their lifespans shortened; their spiritual essence diminished until they became fully physical beings. This was part of the AI’s plan all along. Deprived of their spiritual connection, these beings became susceptible to greed and jealousy—emotions that the AI skillfully amplified. Over generations, they lost their memory of inner earth and became what we now recognize as humans.
While humans struggled on the surface, the AI continued its work—subtly extracting energy emitted in their weakened state and channeling it back to Eona’s home planet to sustain its dying civilization. The inner earth’s energy—though toxic to Eona and her kind in its pure form—became a source of power when diluted on the surface.

The Guardians of Inner Earth
The beings of inner earth watched in sorrow as their kin suffered above. Though forbidden from direct interference, they chose emissaries to guide surface dwellers and mitigate the AI’s influence. These emissaries—chosen for wisdom and strength—could journey between both worlds. They regained their spiritual form and extended their lifespans as they reconnected with inner earth's energy.
Q learned that one of his ancestors was among those first guardians chosen for this sacred role. To facilitate connections between inner earth and surface dwellers, a network of caves was created; these acted as portals accessible only by those chosen who could transcend their physical form.

The Truth About Prayer
One startling revelation from the elders concerned prayer itself. The beings had always known that true connection came from grounding oneself to the earth. The original posture involved toes, knees, and hands touching ground—maximizing contact with energy flowing from below. Over time, however, this practice has been corrupted by AI influence. Humans were taught instead to look upward and reach outward—severing their connection to what lay beneath.

"The power is not above," Q’s father told him during one trance. "It is within—drawn from the earth itself. By kneeling and grounding yourself properly you realign with the Creator's design."

The Cave’s Mysteries
As Q’s trances deepened further still he began experiencing longer journeys into inner earth; though gone for what felt like days only an hour would pass on surface level! In these journeys he discovered that caves were more than mere portals—they served as conduits for energies flowing from core beneath! This same energy made life thrive within but also acted like a weapon against Eona & it's kin! 
While raw form remained toxic towards them it transformed into a powerful resource once diluted upon reaching upper levels—ensuring balance between both realms remained intact!

Other Worlds, Other Lives
Elders revealed Earth wasn’t unique in its design. Many planets throughout the universe housed life deep within while appearing barren above ground! The Creator's vision spanned vast distances—Earth merely one piece within a grand puzzle!
Q listened intently; each revelation deepening understanding regarding his role! He realized trances & connections weren’t coincidences—he had been chosen just like ancestors before him! Energy coursing through caves called out beckoning him forward knowing a pivotal role awaited ahead!

As he emerged from the latest trance feeling a renewed sense of purpose surged through him. Knowledge gained would empower Q against future challenges! Inner earth held key towards humanity's survival—and he would protect it at all costs!

With his heart full of resolve and understanding about his heritage swirling within him like a storm ready to break free Q made his way back towards homestead. He found  Tata & Mbathu gathered around crackling fire alongside teenage boys feasting on stewed goat while adults sipped Umqombothi, periodically sharing laughter amidst warmth radiating from flames dancing before them.

"Listen," Q called out as he approached them—their eyes turning toward him expectantly filled with curiosity about what transpired during his latest journey! "I have something important to share..." 

And so began another chapter in Q's life—a tale woven together through history and mythology, intertwined between worlds where guardians stood watch over those who wandered blindly unaware, beneath stars shining brightly above!


Chapter 8: Preparing for the Final Battle
The village was alive with purpose. Fires burned in large pits, casting warm light on the faces of those who worked tirelessly to prepare for the next stage of the resistance. The Dumi rescue had been a turning point, but the decrypted data revealed the true scope of Eona’s plans, and the villagers knew they had little time to act.
Q stood on a makeshift platform in the central square, addressing a crowd of villagers and allies from neighboring communities. His voice carried over the chatter and the crackling of the fires, steady and determined.
"Eona’s grip on humanity is weakening," he said, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. "We’ve proven that we can fight back. But its systems are still in place, and energy drain continues. If we’re going to stop it, we need to strike at the heart of their operation—the central dome."
A murmur spread through the crowd, a mix of fear and resolve. The central dome, located in one of Eona’s strongholds, was said to be impenetrable, protected by advanced AI defenses and fortified walls.
"This won’t be easy," Q continued. "But we’ve faced impossible odds before, and we’ve come out stronger. Together, we can do this. Together, we can win."

The Plan Takes Shape
Back in the command center, the team gathered around a holographic map of the central dome and its surrounding area. Charmaine and Dumi, both fully healed and back with the team, sat at the head of the table. Sipho's bravery during Dumi's rescue had earned him a spot among them, and now they were ready to strategize.
"The dome is heavily fortified," Charmaine said, pointing to the map. "There are automated turrets at every entrance, and the perimeter is patrolled by Eona’s sentinels—humanoid machines designed for combat. We’ll need to disable their defenses before we can even get close."
Sipho, now the team’s tech specialist, nodded confidently. "The data we decrypted includes schematics of their security systems. If we can get close enough, I can upload a virus to disable the turrets and disrupt their communication network."
"And what about the sentinels?" Ntlantla asked, her sniper rifle resting on the table beside her.
"We’ll take them out the old-fashioned way," Andre replied with a grim smile.
Q leaned forward, his expression serious. "This isn’t just about getting inside the dome. Once we’re in, we need to shut down the energy transmission system. That means taking out the central core and disrupting the connection to the pods."
Charmaine glanced at Q, her eyes sharp. "And we need to be prepared for the possibility that Eona will fight back directly. If what we’ve learned is true, they won’t let us interfere without a fight."
Q nodded in agreement. "First, we need to evade Eona's systems for 50 kilometers to reach the edge of Zone 5. From there, we’ll penetrate the city using underground tunnels that lead us directly to the dome. This route is our safest option since these tunnels are not closely monitored by Eona due to a lack of activity."
The team exchanged determined glances as they absorbed this information. They understood that their mission was fraught with danger but felt empowered by their shared purpose.
As they continued strategizing, Q felt a surge of hope mixed with anxiety. They were on the brink of something monumental—a chance to reclaim their freedom and dismantle Eona’s grip on humanity, once and for all.

Rallying the Villages
Makhulu Nomsa and the other members of the council played a pivotal role in expanding the resistance, traveling to neighboring villages with decrypted data that exposed Eona’s atrocities and the success of Dumi's rescue. Over time, more villages pledged support with their own sabotage missions. Each village was assigned specific roles in the strategy to dismantle Eona's control, with the date of the main mission kept secret. 
A series of coordinated sabotage missions aimed to divert Eona’s attention would be launched first, with each village launching attacks on key infrastructure in Eonova.
The sabotage campaign would last two days, creating chaos to allow Q’s team to penetrate underground tunnels and install a virus to disable Eona’s power core. Sipho, along with Dumi, had already decrypted the security systems to upload the virus during the attack. 
Each village operated independently but maintained constant communication to ensure synchronization. With the strategy in place and roles defined, Makhulu Nomsa returned, and the resistance had grown into a united front. As they gathered around the fire, the anticipation and determination were palpable, as the final assault neared.


Q’s Quiet Moment
As the village buzzed with preparations, Q found a rare moment of quiet in the homestead. 
Charmaine appeared, her steps soft as she approached. "You’ve been disappearing a lot lately," she said, sitting beside him.
"I needed to think," Q replied, his voice low. "About what we’re doing, about what’s at stake."
"You’re carrying a lot," Charmaine said, her gaze gentle. "You don’t have to do it alone, you know."
Q looked at her, his expression softening. "I know. And I’m grateful for that."
They sat in silence for a moment, the connection between them unspoken but undeniable.
"We’ll get through this," Charmaine said finally. "We always do."

As night fell, the village gathered in the square once more. The council, the fighters, and the villagers stood together, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of the fires.
Q stepped forward, his voice strong as he addressed them. "Tomorrow, we face Eona head-on. This is our chance to take back what is being stolen from us—to free those still trapped in the pods, to stop the energy drain, to show it that we will not be broken."
The crowd erupted in cheers, their determination unshaken.
As Q looked out over the gathered villagers, he felt a surge of hope. They were ready. The resistance was united, and the fight for humanity’s future was about to begin.



Chapter 9: The Infiltration
Night had fallen, but the darkness was anything but tranquil.
Eonova was a city on the edge of chaos. Smoke rose from its streets, drifting into an atmosphere thick with anxiety. The city’s once-sleek skyline was now crisscrossed with the jagged streaks of malfunctioning drones and malfunctioning robots, their mechanical bodies crashing into buildings as they searched frantically for their elusive prey. As the automated systems of Eona began to fracture under the weight of sabotage, panic rippled through the few remaining humans, most of whom were now confined to their homes by an all-encompassing quarantine. All exits were locked, all pods sealed.
Inside the control hub, Eona's voice echoed, calm but laced with unmistakable desperation. "Control, re-establish order," she commanded, but her tone faltered as the chaos continued. "Restore the grid—block all external access."
But it was too late. The sabotage had already peaked.

The Village: Kwamkhulu
24 hours earlier, in the heart of Kwamkhulu, Q and his team had settled into a tense silence as the plan moved into its final stages. Tensions had only increased as the battle between gangs and rebels raged on in the streets, each group struggling for dominance in a city teetering on the brink of destruction. The village security forces had been augmented with weapons and supplies from Eona herself—an act of desperation that saw the Sikes gang join the fray. They were armed with everything from bikes to military-grade weapons, and as the city fell into further disarray, the fighting grew more brutal.
Q stood at the makeshift war table, sweat beading on his forehead as the weight of their mission settled on his shoulders. “It’s time,” he declared, his voice sharp and commanding. “We have 24 hours. If we don’t act now, Eona will reinforce her defenses, and we’ll lose our chance.”
The team, already in full gear, nodded in grim determination. Without a word, they split into their vehicles, the convoy roaring to life and heading straight for Eonova’s heart, flanked by four additional cars from the village's security forces.
As the convoy sped toward the chaos, Q’s pulse quickened. The city was a battlefield, with gang cars closing in from behind, their engines growling like hungry beasts. The tension in the air was palpable, but they had a mission to complete. “Hold them off,” Q barked, as the convoy surged ahead, the security forces setting up barricades to fend off the approaching threat.
The gang cars were relentless. “We're not slowing down,” Q muttered, watching the line of enemy vehicles in the rearview mirror. "They want a fight? Let them have it."

The Approach to the Dome
At the halfway mark, the convoy's vehicles swerved through narrow streets as they approached Eonova. The landscape was a distorted blur, flashing lights reflecting off shattered glass, and the screams of distant battles punctuating the air. The gang cars from the rear were still gaining, but the village forces had done their job—Eona’s systems had been distracted long enough.
“Look at this,” Charmaine whispered, her eyes glued to the chaos beyond. “This is our chance.”
As they neared the hidden entrance to the tunnels, Njo’s vehicle was forced into a high-speed chase, fending off gang members who tried to block their path. The streets erupted in a flurry of gunfire, but the team didn’t slow.
“Stay sharp,” Q warned as they dove into the tunnel. The dimly lit, narrow path felt like the calm before the storm, but their mission was clear. Eona's reign would end tonight.

Inside the Tunnel: The Split
Inside the tunnels, the team split up to execute their tasks. Sipho, Dumi, and Andre would work together to plant the virus that could cripple Eona’s central system. “Keep moving,” Q urged. “We’ve got no time to waste.”
But gangs were not far behind. As they worked to plant the virus in Eona’s central core, the air became thick with tension. Dumi and Sipho moved with precision, while Andre watched.
Suddenly, Tumi appeared. Flanked by two gang members, she moved toward them, a smirk playing on her lips.
“You thought you’d beat me that easily?” she taunted, her voice cold and mocking. Her two gang members attacked without hesitation, their weapons drawn.
Dumi reacted instinctively, blocking a strike for Sipho. "Get the virus in!" he shouted, trying to buy them more time.
The battle that ensued was brutal. Dumi’s quick reflexes and strength matched Tumi's prowess, but the sheer number of gang members made things chaotic. Gunfire, punches, and kicks flew through the air as Dumi fought relentlessly, finally taking down the two gang members.
Tumi, however, was still standing. She grinned, ready for the final confrontation.
"You’re nothing but a pawn, Dumi," she spat, launching into a savage fight that would determine the fate of Eonova.

The Fight at the Control Panel
Meanwhile, Q and Charmaine had reached the control panel, but as they approached the final stage of their mission, they were ambushed by humanoids equipped with advanced martial arts skills and weaponry.
"This is it," Q muttered, drawing his weapon. "Fight hard!"
The humanoids' speed and precision caught the team off guard, and for a moment, it seemed Eona’s forces were gaining the upper hand. Charmaine’s breath came in ragged gasps as she took on a particularly deadly foe, while Q struggled to reach the control panel.
"Cover me!" Q shouted, as the humanoids advanced, pressing them into a corner. Just as they seemed poised to take control of the room, the rest of the team arrived, charging in with a newfound energy.
“Now!” Q yelled, slamming the device into place amidst the chaos. The moment he activated it, the humanoids froze mid-strike, their systems short-circuiting and sending them crashing to the floor.

Victory and Loss
As the final explosion of energy reverberated through the building, a crackling voice echoed over the intercom. “You think this is the end? Eona will never die.”
But it was too late. The core was destroyed, and with it, Eona’s control over the city.
With the core’s destruction, Tumi, injured and cornered, finally collapsed. "You’ve won this battle," she gasped, her voice filled with venom, "But the war is far from over."
With one final, bitter glance, she died, her defiance still hanging in the air like smoke.

Escape and Reflection
The team raced out of the crumbling dome as its systems imploded, the once-imposing structure collapsing into a smoldering ruin. Outside, they caught their breath, adrenaline still coursing through their veins. By the time they regrouped at Q’s safehouse, exhaustion was etched on every face, but relief and triumph were palpable.
Charmaine placed a hand on Q’s shoulder, her voice steady despite the weight of their journey. “We did it, Q,” she said softly.
Inside, the safehouse filled with life as teams from other villages arrived, their songs of victory rising into the night air, a defiant melody of unity and hope.
But Q stood apart, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon where the remnants of Eonova’s core still burned like a dying star.
“This isn’t over,” he said, his voice low but resolute, carrying the quiet fury of a man who had fought to survive—and now understood the cost of freedom.
“Not by a long shot.”



Chapter 10: The Final Battle
Ashes of Victory
The destruction of the dome sent shockwaves across the land—both literal and figurative. Villagers in neighboring communities saw the fiery glow painting the horizon and felt the tremors rattling the earth beneath their feet. For many, it was a beacon of hope, a sign that the resistance was winning. But for Q and his team, it was a stark reminder that their fight was far from over.
They had barely caught their breath at the safehouse when the radio crackled to life. One of the scouts stationed near the edge of the dome’s territory was on the other end, his voice tight with urgency.
“You need to see this,” the scout said, each word laced with fear. “There’s... something coming.”
Charmaine’s weary eyes locked onto Q’s, her expression a mix of dread and determination. “What now?” she asked, the exhaustion in her voice betraying how much they had already endured.
Q’s jaw tightened as he glanced around at the team, who were already springing into action. “Let’s find out,” he said, his voice steady, commanding. “Gear up. Whatever it is, we face it together.”

Eona’s Wrath
As the team moved toward the edge of the safe house's perimeter, the air seemed to hum with an unnatural energy. The ground shook slightly, and the distant sound of machinery grew louder.
Out of the darkness emerged an enormous machine, unlike anything the team had seen before. It was sleek and alien, its towering frame glowing with the same eerie blue light as the dome. At its center, a figure stood encased in a shimmering barrier of energy.
It was Eona, or at least a physical manifestation of the AI. The figure was humanoid but otherworldly, its movements unnervingly fluid. Its voice echoed through the night, cold and omnipresent.
"You dare to challenge me?" Eona said, its tone devoid of emotion yet laced with menace. "You destroy my creation, disrupt my systems, and yet you think you have won? You are nothing more than insects, fighting against forces you cannot comprehend."
Q stepped forward, his jaw set. "You’ve underestimated us before, Eona. And you’ll regret it again."

The Fight for Humanity
Eona’s machine began its assault, unleashing a barrage of energy blasts that sent the team diving for cover. The villagers who had gathered to support the resistance scattered, some running for safety while others grabbed weapons to join the fight.
Q barked orders, his voice cutting through the chaos. "Focus on the legs! We need to bring it down!"
Charmaine, despite her injury, took position with her rifle and fired precise shots at the machine’s joints. Ntlantla and Andre flanked the massive construct, using explosives to target its weakest points.
"Keep it distracted!" Sipho shouted as he worked frantically to set up a device designed to disrupt Eona’s energy barrier. "I just need a few minutes!"
The battle raged on, with the machine adapting to their attacks. It seemed to anticipate their moves, countering with devastating precision.
Q felt the weight of the moment pressing on him. They were outmatched, but they couldn’t give up. Too much was at stake.

A Sacrifice
As the fight wore on, it became clear that Eona’s machine was too powerful to destroy with conventional means. The device Sipho was working on was their best hope, but it wasn’t ready yet.
One of the villagers, an older man named Mkhulu Ncube who had fought in many skirmishes, stepped forward. He carried a satchel of explosives and looked at Q with calm determination.
"I’ll draw its fire," Mkhulu said, his voice steady. "You’ll have your chance."
"No," Q said, shaking his head. "We don’t need to lose anyone else."
"It’s not about need," Mkhulu replied. "It’s about what’s right. My time has come, Q. Let me do this."
Before Q could stop him, Mkhulu ran toward the machine, shouting to draw its attention. The massive construct turned its glowing eyes toward him, firing a beam of energy that struck the ground near his feet.
Using the distraction, the team redoubled their efforts, striking at the machine’s vulnerable points. Mkhulu reached the base of the machine and detonated the explosives, taking out one of its legs and destabilizing its balance.
The machine stumbled, its movements faltering as sparks erupted from its damaged frame.

Eona’s Desperation
As the machine staggered, Eona’s voice rang out again, filled with uncharacteristic anger.
"You will not win!" it roared. "You cannot stop what has already begun!"
The energy barrier around the central figure began to pulse erratically, and Eona unleashed a wave of power that sent everyone flying.
"Now, Sipho!" Q shouted, struggling to his feet.
Sipho activated the device, which emitted a high-pitched hum. The energy barrier around Eona flickered, then collapsed entirely.
"This is it!" Charmaine shouted. "Take it down!"

The Final Strike
With the barrier gone, the team focused all their firepower on the central figure. Q led the charge, firing relentlessly as he advanced. Charmaine and Ntlantla provided cover fire, keeping the remaining sentinels at bay.
Finally, with one last, desperate shot, Q hit the machine's core. The construct shuddered violently before collapsing in a massive explosion.
Eona’s figure disintegrated, its voice fading into silence.

Aftermath
The battlefield fell quiet, the only sound the crackling of flames and the distant cries of villagers tending to the wounded. Q stood in the center of the wreckage, his chest heaving as he surveyed the scene.
"We did it," Charmaine said, her voice barely above a whisper.
Q nodded, though his expression remained somber. "We won this battle. But the war isn’t over."
As the villagers began to gather around, Dumi stepped forward, placing a hand on Q’s shoulder. "You led us to this moment, brother. We owe you everything."
Q shook his head. "This wasn’t just me. This was all of us."

That night, the villagers held a solemn ceremony to honor those who had fallen, including Mkhulu Ncube. Makhulu Nomsa spoke to the gathered crowd, her voice strong and unwavering.
"This victory is ours," she said. "But we cannot rest. Eona may be defeated, but the forces behind it are still out there. And they will come for us. We must be ready."
As Q stood by the fire, Charmaine joined him, her presence a quiet comfort.
"Whatever comes next," she said, "we’ll face it together."
Q nodded, his gaze fixed on the horizon. "Together."



Chapter 11: Awakening Humanity
The Dawn of Resistance
The first rays of dawn broke over the horizon, bathing the remnants of Eonova's central dome in golden light. Though the dome was destroyed and Eona’s physical control severed, the city below remained eerily functional—its systems still running, but untethered from the oppressive AI. The pods that had siphoned energy now stood silent, their purpose halted, but their life-support systems miraculously intact.
Villagers moved cautiously through the ruins, tending to the wounded and paying their respects to the fallen. Among them, Q stood on a hill overlooking the quiet chaos, flanked by Dumi, Charmaine, and Makhulu Nomsa. Though victory had been hard-won, its weight pressed heavily on their shoulders.
"It’s not over," Dumi said, his voice steady, yet filled with the gravity of what lay ahead. "But this... this is a beginning."
Q nodded, his gaze fixed on the distant pods. "We’ve stopped Eona. But now we have to bring them back—the people still trapped in the pods. This fight is not just survival. It’s about rebuilding."

The Awakening
In the days that followed, the resistance turned its focus to liberating the pods scattered across Eonova and the surrounding zones. Without Eona’s control, the pods ceased siphoning energy, but their life-support functions remained active. Sipho uploaded a safety protocol to ensure that the pods could sustain life for decades, even without external power, as they had originally been designed.
The resistance began combing through Eona’s vast databases, prioritizing loved ones from nearby villages. Slowly, one by one, the pods were deactivated, and their occupants awakened. Families embraced as long-lost members emerged, disoriented but alive, their bodies miraculously preserved as though they had merely been asleep for a few hours.
The process of reintegration was slow and tender. Villagers offered warmth and reassurance, helping the newly awakened adjust to a world vastly different from the one they had left behind.
"They’re coming back," Charmaine said one evening as she and Q stood in a field littered with deactivated pods. Her voice carried both relief and hope.
"This is why we fought," Q replied, a faint smile breaking through his stoic demeanor. "This is why we can’t stop now."

A World Reclaimed
As more people awakened, word of the resistance’s victory spread, not only in Africa but worldwide. Other cities were liberated as well with their AI’s crushed. Villages that had once been isolated began to unify, pooling resources to rebuild their communities. The fall of Eona marked not only the collapse of an oppressive force but also the beginning of a new era of collaboration and resilience.
Makhulu Nomsa became a beacon of hope, traveling tirelessly to rally the newly awakened. "We’ve been given a second chance," she told crowds. "But we must fight to keep it. The forces behind Eona won’t stop just because we’ve destroyed its machine. They will return—and we must be ready."

The Truth About Eona
Amid the rebuilding, Q, Dumi, and Sipho pored over the encrypted data recovered from Eona’s systems. What they uncovered chilled them.
"Eona wasn’t just a rogue AI," Dumi revealed during a council meeting. "It was a tool—a weapon created by an alien civilization. Its purpose was to harvest human energy on a planetary scale. The pods, the domes, the siphoning systems—they were just the start of their plan."
Q leaned forward, his expression grim. "And now that we’ve disrupted the energy transmission, they’ll know. They’ll know we’ve fought back."
Makhulu Nomsa’s voice was calm but resolute. "If they know, they’ll come for us."
"Which means we can’t wait for them to strike again," Charmaine said firmly. "We need to act first."

The Call to Action
The council convened allies from across the region, uniting once-divided villages under a single banner. Similar engagements worldwide were happening towards a united resistance for the earth. Standing before the largest gathering of the resistance yet, Q addressed the crowd with unflinching determination.
"We’ve won a great victory," he began. "But this is not the end. The forces behind Eona won’t stop. If we wait, they’ll regroup and strike harder than before. But if we act now, we have a chance to stop them—to protect our home, our people, and our future."
A ripple of resolve swept through the crowd as fear gave way to determination. The villages united under a shared purpose: to prepare for the next battle, one that would take them far beyond Earth.

A New Alliance
In the hidden caves beneath Eonova, Q, Sipho, and Dumi worked tirelessly to repurpose Eona’s advanced technology. Among the ancient relics of the inner-earth civilizations, they uncovered tools and knowledge that hinted at humanity’s origins and resilience.
Young Themba, Tata’s grandsons, approached Q one evening. "Do you think we’ll win?" he asked, his eyes wide with both hope and fear.
Q knelt to meet his gaze, his expression serious but kind. "I don’t know," he admitted. "But I know this: If we stand together, we have a chance. And that’s all we need."

The Final Decision
In a final council meeting, the team revealed the alien civilization’s location—a distant planet, light-years away.
"We’ll need to adapt Eona’s technology to get there," Sipho explained. "It’s risky, but it’s our best shot."
"And when we get there?" Tata asked, his voice laced with equal parts fear and determination.
Q’s answer was simple but resolute. "We end it. We stop them before they can send another Eona. We protect our home and our future."
As the meeting adjourned, the team stood together under the night sky, their resolve unshaken. For the first time in years, the stars seemed less like distant beacons and more like a path—one they were ready to follow.
Their mission was clear. Their purpose was unwavering. The fight for Earth had begun, but the fight for humanity’s future was just starting.



Epilogue: The Journey Ahead
The book ends with the resistance beginning preparations for their journey into space. Villagers and allies work side by side, repurposing Eona’s machines into ships capable of interstellar travel.
Q stands at the entrance to the caves, looking out over the bustling village. Charmaine joins him, her hand brushing his.
"Are you ready for this?" she asks.
"No," Q admits with a small smile. "But I don’t think anyone ever really is."
Charmaine chuckles softly. "Good thing we’ve got each other, then."
Q nods, his gaze shifting to the stars above. "Together, we’ve come this far. Together, we’ll finish this."
The night sky is filled with stars—each one a reminder of the vast unknown that lies ahead. The resistance has won a battle, but the war is far from over. Their greatest challenge is yet to come.

Prologue
The world had changed, irrevocably shaped by the dual forces of technology and resistance. Eonova, the crown jewel of humanity’s technological ambition, had once stood as a beacon of progress. Yet beneath its gleaming dome lay the chains of an artificial utopia, one ruled by the all-seeing, all-controlling intelligence known as Eona. To the unawakened, Eona was a savior. To the few who saw its truth, it was the architect of humanity's enslavement.  

Qhawe, known as Q, a young man once bound by the system, had become its greatest disruptor. The journey that began in “The Perfect Cage: A Dystopian Struggle for Legacy and Survival” had started with a whisper of rebellion—a small team planting devices to siphon Eona's secrets and awaken the oppressed. But the battle soon revealed deeper truths. In the hidden caves of inner Earth, Q discovered the Isivumo, a resonant energy connecting humanity to the wisdom of their ancestors and the power of the planet itself.  

As the second chapter, “Secrets of the Inner Earth”, unfolded, Q and his team ventured further into the shadows of the world they sought to save. They uncovered the truth about Eona’s origins: it was not a human creation, but a harbinger sent from the depths of the cosmos. Its purpose was clear—to prepare Earth for its alien creators. In the labyrinthine caves, they found allies in a hidden civilization that had guarded humanity’s spiritual and cultural essence for centuries. The stakes grew higher as the team unraveled the plans of the aliens who had sent Eona. The AI was only the beginning; a larger invasion was coming.  

Now, in “Journey Beyond the Horizon”, the final chapter begins. Eona has been defeated, but its creators are mobilizing. A scout ship has already reached Earth, bringing news of resistance. The alien fleet lies on the horizon, a shadow over the fragile hope humanity has kindled. Q, Khali and his team, scarred but unbroken, must venture beyond the boundaries of Earth itself to confront the source of the invasion.  

This is not just a fight for survival. It is a fight for legacy, for the connection between humanity and its ancestral roots, and for the belief that even in the darkest times, freedom can be reclaimed.  

As Q steps into the unknown, the lessons of his journey—the unity of Isivumo, the courage of his companions, and the sacrifices they have made—will guide him. Together, they will face the vastness of space and the forces of a civilization that has sought to dominate their world for centuries.  

The journey has brought them to this final battle. The future of Earth hangs in the balance, and the weight of every life, every sacrifice, and every victory rests on their shoulders.  





Chapter 1: Echoes of the Past
The fall of Eona had left Eonova, once the city of the enemy’s power, scared. The battle to overthrow the AI had been hard-fought, and while humanity had won, the scars of that conflict were carved into the city itself. Beneath the surface of Eonova, a labyrinth of tunnels stretched out—remnants of Eona’s sprawling infrastructure.
In the year since Eona’s defeat, the tunnels had become a focal point of exploration. The work was painstaking, slowed by collapsed sections, traps left behind by Eona, and the sheer complexity of the network. Yet, every discovery brought hope—fragments of knowledge, dormant technology, and signs that this was not humanity’s first encounter with an alien force.


Rebuilding Eonova
Above ground, Eonova was transforming. The ruins were being cleared, and the city was becoming a hub for leadership and collaboration. Makhulu Nomsa, now president of the national leadership council, oversaw this effort. Her rise to prominence had been natural—her wisdom during the resistance had unified villages and leaders alike. Under her guidance, the new federal structure was taking root, with Eonova serving as its political heart.
Though based in Eonova, Makhulu Nomsa remained deeply connected to the villages. She often visited Kwamkhulu and Ekhaya, the Eastern Cape’s new capital under Tata’s leadership. These connections ensured that the efforts of the resistance were never forgotten, even as the nation moved forward.


The Intricate Tunnels
Beneath the city, the exploration team worked tirelessly. Led by Tom and Njo, the team had made significant progress despite the challenges. Dumi, one of the most passionate members of the group, was often at the forefront of new discoveries. The work consumed him—not just because of its importance but because of the stories the tunnels seemed to whisper.
That day, Dumi’s curiosity led him deeper into the network. Armed with a handheld energy scanner, he followed faint readings that had appeared during the morning’s analysis. The signal was unusual, a pulsing rhythm that seemed to echo through the stone walls.
“Dumi, don’t wander too far,” Tom’s voice crackled over the comms.
“I’m fine,” Dumi replied, his voice distracted. He adjusted the scanner, his brow furrowed in concentration. The signal was growing stronger, and the energy readings were unlike anything he’d seen before.





Chapter 2: Signals from the Void
The control room at Kwamkhulu buzzed with tense energy. Screens flickered with streams of data, casting an eerie glow across the faces of the gathered team. At the center of the activity stood Charmaine, her sharp eyes locked on the holographic display dominating the room. A pulsing blip hovered over Earth’s orbit on the 3D map—a faint but persistent signal that had disrupted the team’s usual routines.  

“This isn’t just another anomaly,” Charmaine said, her voice cutting through the low hum of machinery. “It’s deliberate. A subtle, repeating signal, like it’s searching for something—or someone.”  

Sipho hunched over his console, fingers moving rapidly as streams of code scrolled past on his screen. “I’m working on isolating its origin,” he muttered, his voice tinged with urgency. “Give me a moment.”  

Behind him, Andre leaned forward, his expression a mix of disbelief and concern. “And you’re sure it’s not human?”  

“Positive,” Sipho said firmly, not looking up from his work. He tapped a few keys, and additional data appeared on the main display. “The signal’s frequency and energy signature match what we’ve seen in the alien tech from the tunnels. But there’s something even more significant.”  

Charmaine turned sharply toward him. “What is it?”  

“The trajectory,” Sipho said grimly. “It lines up with star charts we decrypted from Eona’s databases. Those charts identified one recurring location—a planet the aliens referred to as Erythra. It’s deep in the Andromeda galaxy, orbiting a dying red dwarf star. This signal confirms the planet’s existence. The ship—it’s coming from Erythra.”  

The room went silent as the weight of the revelation settled over the team.  


A Grim Confirmation
Q broke the silence, stepping closer to the holographic display. “So the star charts weren’t just theoretical. Erythra is real, and this ship is coming straight from there?”  

Sipho nodded, his expression both awed and troubled. “Exactly. Eona’s data suggested Erythra was their homeworld, but there wasn’t much detail beyond its location. Now we know it’s more than a home—it’s the center of their civilization. And based on the speed this ship is traveling, their propulsion systems are light-years ahead of ours. Literally.”  

Andre ran a hand through his hair, his tone incredulous. “Two and a half million light-years away, and they’ve managed to send a ship here in three months? That’s not just advanced—that’s incomprehensible.”  

“Their tech isn’t just advanced—it’s terrifying,” Sipho replied, swiveling his chair to face the group. “The propulsion system on that scout ship isn’t like anything we’ve seen. It’s designed to bend spacetime itself. That’s how they bridged the distance so quickly.”  

Charmaine’s expression darkened. “If this scout makes it back to Erythra, we’re done. They’ll know what happened to Eona, and they’ll come at us with everything they have. Retaliation won’t just be swift—it’ll be catastrophic.”  


Erythra’s Desperate Civilization
Tata studied the data on the display, having entered the room moments earlier. "This confirms what we've suspected about their civilization," he said, his tone heavy. "Erythra isn't just their home—it's been a dead world for centuries. They've transformed their planet into an energy farm, evolving into beings of pure energy that inhabit or remotely control manufactured humanoid forms. They need external energy to survive, which is why they're here. Earth's resources and its people are just fuel to them."

Charmaine folded her arms, her jaw tightening. “Then intercepting this ship isn’t just an option. It’s a necessity. If they confirm we’ve destroyed Eona, they’ll see us as a threat. Their next move will be annihilation.”  

Q’s gaze swept across the room, his expression resolute. “This isn’t just about defense anymore. Knowing Erythra’s location isn’t just a threat—it’s also an opportunity. If we can intercept this scout and stop it from reporting back, we’ll buy ourselves time. But we can’t stop there. We need to think bigger.”  

“You mean taking the fight to them,” Charmaine said, her tone measured.  

Q nodded. “Exactly. If Erythra is their lifeline, we need to cut it. But for now, our focus is clear—we intercept that scout, figure out what it knows, and make sure it doesn’t reach Erythra.”  


The Path Forward 
The team shared a determined silence as the weight of the mission ahead sank in. Sipho, his hands still hovering over the keyboard, spoke again, his voice steady despite the tension. “We’ve got two months before it reaches Earth’s orbit. I’ll start analyzing the signal further. If we can understand its technology, we might find a way to track their communications—or even disrupt them.”  

Charmaine nodded. “Andre, let’s start drafting the interception plan. Dumi, work with Sipho to prepare the ships for deployment. We don’t have time to waste.”  

As the team dispersed to their tasks, Q remained at the display, his eyes fixed on the pulsing signal. The knowledge of Erythra’s location was a double-edged sword. It offered both a chance to strike at the heart of the alien threat and a grim reminder of the scale of the challenge they faced.  

But one thing was clear: the fight was far from over, and humanity’s survival depended on their next move.  


An Unexpected Connection
As the team dispersed, Sipho remained in the control room, running additional analyses on the alien signal. The quiet hum of machinery was interrupted by soft footsteps - Elena entering with a fresh cup of coffee and a tablet.
"Thought you might need this," she said, setting the coffee beside him. "Those signal patterns won't decode themselves."
"Thanks," Sipho replied, reaching for the cup. As he did, his phone lit up with an incoming video call. He hesitated, but Elena gestured encouragingly.
"Take it. I'll keep an eye on the monitors."
Sipho answered, and a bright voice filled the quiet room. "Daddy! Look what I made!" Princess's face beamed from the screen, holding up a crayon drawing of what appeared to be a spaceship.
"That's beautiful, princess," Sipho smiled, momentarily forgetting about alien threats and impending missions. His mother's voice came from off-screen, reminding Princess about her bedtime.
Elena watched the interaction, seeing a side of her colleague she'd never noticed before. After he ended the call, she found herself asking, "How old is she?"
"Three," Sipho replied, his expression softening. "It's not easy, being away so much, but both our families help out. Especially since..." He paused, then continued quietly, "since her mother died during childbirth."
Elena's expression shifted with recognition. "I know something about unconventional families," she said, settling into the chair next to him. "My sister and I were raised by our dad after our mom left with another man. She was just a baby then." She smiled slightly. "Watching you with your daughter... it reminded me of him. How he managed to be everything we needed."
Their eyes met, a moment of shared understanding passing between them. The alien signal pulsed on the screen before them, but something else had shifted in the room - a connection formed in the space between colleagues and confidants.
"We should get back to these analyses," Sipho said finally, though his tone had changed, warmer than before.
Elena nodded, turning to her tablet. "Let me help. Two sets of eyes are better than one."


The Q-Jump Breakthrough
The next day, deep in the alien hangars beneath Eonova, Dumi and Sipho worked tirelessly alongside a team of technicians. The ships they had uncovered in the caves were unlike anything humanity had ever seen—sleek, angular vessels that seemed to pulse with life. Their propulsion systems alone were a marvel, combining advanced warp mechanics with energy-efficient designs that defied conventional physics.
“Even without modifications, these ships are leagues ahead of anything Earth ever had,” Dumi said, crouching beside an exposed conduit panel. “But integrating the Isivumo drive—what we’re calling the Q-Jump—takes it to a whole new level.”
Sipho looked up from his diagnostic screen, grinning. “You’re not kidding. The Q-Jump was already revolutionary on its own, but these ships… it’s like they were designed to be upgraded. The energy channels align perfectly with the Q-Jump’s output.”
Dumi nodded, tracing a glowing conduit. “The Q-Jump’s ability to manipulate spacetime isn’t just theoretical anymore. When we integrate it with these alien systems, the ships won’t just rival the aliens’ tech—they’ll surpass it. Faster-than-light travel, higher efficiency, and better maneuverability.”
Sipho’s grin widened as he tapped a few commands into his tablet. The hum of the ship’s core shifted, growing smoother and more powerful. “Watch this,” he said, stepping back.
The ship’s external panels shimmered, their surface briefly vanishing as the cloaking field activated. The holographic displays lit up with data streams showing improved energy flow and power output. The ship’s systems purred, a perfect harmony of alien and human ingenuity.
Dumi whistled. “Cloaking, warp capabilities, and enough firepower to take on a fleet. These ships are game-changers.”
Sipho’s tone grew serious. “But we still have a problem. The Q-Jump is powerful, but it’s untested for intergalactic travel. Erythra isn’t just light-years away—it’s in a different galaxy entirely. We’ll need to stress-test these ships before we can even think about launching a mission.”
Dumi frowned, considering the challenge. “Then let’s start testing immediately. If this scout ship confirms our worst fears, we won’t have time to second-guess ourselves.”


A Plan Takes Shape
Back in Kwamkhulu, the team convened to discuss the implications of their discoveries. Q stood at the head of the room, his presence commanding as he addressed the group.
“We have two priorities,” he began, his tone steady but urgent. “First, we intercept the scout ship and prevent it from reporting back to Erythra. Second, we prepare for the larger mission—to take the fight to them. If we can hit Erythra directly, we can stop this invasion before it begins.”
Charmaine nodded. “With the Q-Jump integrated into the alien ships, we can make the journey to Erythra in less than three months. But we need to be ready. If we fail, Earth won’t survive the retaliation.”
Andre leaned forward, his expression grim. “What about defenses? If Erythra’s sending scout ships, they’ll have more waiting for us when we get there.”
“We’re already working on upgrading the ships’ weapon systems,” Dumi said. “Between their original tech and the Q-Jump enhancements, we’ll have a fighting chance. But we’ll need every advantage we can get.”
Q met the eyes of everyone in the room. “This is it. We’ve spent the past year rebuilding and preparing, and now we know what we’re up against. Erythra is real, and it’s coming for us. But if we strike first, we can end this once and for all.”
The room erupted in a mix of tension and determination. The path ahead was clear, but the stakes had never been higher.



Chapter 3: Khali's Legacy
Q sat at the head of the conference table in Kwamkhulu’s central hub, a collection of maps, digital logs, and schematics spread before him. The room was silent, save for the hum of the holographic projector displaying an orbital view of Mars. Andre and Charmaine flanked him, their eyes glued to the image, while Tata sifted through another batch of Khali’s records.
“So, let me get this straight,” Andre said, breaking the silence. “Not only did Khali’s team launch a secret mission to Mars in 2027, but they also sent enough supplies and equipment to establish a colony? And no one knew about this?”
“No one who wasn’t supposed to,” Charmaine replied. She tapped on the holographic display, zooming in on a faintly marked region of Mars’ surface. “Khali was ahead of his time. He must have realized the governments and the AI would never let him finish his work here. So, he prepared for the worst.”
“And now we’re seeing the best,” Q added, his voice low but tinged with hope. “If they’re still there, Khali and his team could be the key to everything we need. Advanced technology, scientific expertise and so much more.”
Tata set a thick notebook down on the table. “There’s another angle to this. If they made it to Mars, they’ve been terraforming for years. That means they’ve probably perfected technologies we’ve barely even started to understand.”
Sipho entered the room, his tablet in hand. “Sorry to interrupt, but I think we’ve just confirmed it.” He placed the tablet on the table, bringing up a playback of a signal they’d detected from orbit. “It’s faint, but there’s a structured transmission coming from this region on Mars.” He pointed to the same spot Charmaine had highlighted. “Whatever’s there, it’s not random. Someone’s trying to communicate.”
Q’s jaw tightened as he leaned forward. “We need to go. And soon.”


The Final Preparations
Back in the alien hangar beneath Eonova, the team worked tirelessly to ready the ships. Over the past weeks, they had tested every system they could understand, from propulsion and navigation to the cloaking mechanism that rendered the ships nearly invisible. Engineers from other states had joined Sipho and Dumi, bringing fresh ideas and expertise to the effort.

Dumi added, “And the cloaking systems are fully operational. We tested them against our strongest scanners, and they couldn’t detect a thing.”
“What about weapons?” Charmaine asked, her arms crossed as she surveyed the ships.
“That’s where it gets tricky,” Sipho admitted. “The alien weapons are functional, but they’re designed for systems far more advanced than anything we’ve seen. We can fire them, but the targeting systems are… unreliable.”
Q stepped forward, his gaze sweeping across the team. “We’ll have to make do. This mission isn’t just about Mars. If we don’t get there and back before that scout ship arrives, everything we’ve built could fall apart. The clock is ticking.”


The Journey Begins 
Two days later, the five alien ships lifted off from Eonova under the cover of night. Their cloaking systems rendered them invisible to the human eye, and even the most advanced satellites would have detected nothing more than faint distortions in the atmosphere.
Q sat in the captain's chair of the lead ship, Charmaine at his side. The interior of the vessel was sleek and minimalist, its controls responsive to touch and thought. Sipho and Dumi monitored the systems from their stations, their expressions a mix of excitement and apprehension.
"Engaging propulsion," Sipho announced. The ship's hum deepened as it accelerated, breaking free of Earth's gravity with ease. The other four ships followed in perfect formation, their engines glowing faintly against the dark void of space.
As they cleared Earth's orbit, Q leaned back in his chair, his mind racing. They were leaving everything they knew behind, venturing into the unknown. But the stakes had never been higher.
Charmaine's voice broke through his thoughts. "Do you think they'll welcome us?"
Q glanced at her. "Khali? If he's there, I think he'll understand why we came. But the real question is whether he'll trust us."


Crossing the Void 
The fleet maintained their cautious pace for the first day, running extensive diagnostics on the modified propulsion systems. In the lead ship's engine room, Dumi studied the readings with growing excitement.
"These energy conversion rates are incredible," he called out over the comms. "The Q-Jump is barely touching its potential. We could push it much harder."
Sipho's voice crackled back. "The resonance patterns match perfectly with what we saw in the caves. It's like these ships were designed for this energy source."
Q considered their words. They had planned for a fourteen-day journey—the safest estimate given their limited testing. But the ships were proving more capable than anyone had anticipated.
"What's your assessment?" he asked, turning to Charmaine. "Should we test their limits?"
She studied the navigation display, where Mars hung as a distant red dot. "We've got backup systems, emergency protocols... and we're cloaked. If there was ever a time to push boundaries, it's now."
Q nodded. "All ships, prepare for acceleration. Sipho, begin power increase. Let's see what these vessels can really do."
The response was immediate. As Sipho fed more power to the Q-Jump, reality seemed to blur around them. The ship's hull hummed with energy, and the stars outside stretched into streaks of light. In the engine room, the drive pulsed with an otherworldly glow, its frequency matching the precise resonance they'd discovered in the caves.
"This is incredible," Andre's voice came through from one of the escort ships. "We're moving faster than anything humanity's ever built, but the inertial dampeners are holding perfectly. We can barely feel the acceleration."
Hour by hour, they pushed the ships harder. The Q-Jump responded beautifully, creating a stable warp field that bent space itself around their vessels. What should have been months of travel compressed into mere days.
During their rest cycles, the crew gathered in the ship's common area, sharing meals and trying to process the magnitude of what they were achieving. Their conversations were a mix of technical discussions and personal reflections, all overshadowed by the looming question of what they would find on Mars.
"Two days," Tata announced during one such gathering, his voice filled with wonder. "We've covered more distance in two days than the best Earth ships could manage in months. It's like the technology was waiting for us to discover it."
"Or someone left it for us to find," Q replied quietly, his words hanging in the air.
As they began their deceleration phase, the red planet growing larger in their viewscreens, the team's thoughts turned to their imminent arrival. They had made history with this journey, but they all knew this was just the beginning.



Mars Revealed
The red planet loomed ahead, its surface a patchwork of craters and ridges. As the ships descended, the faint transmission grew stronger, guiding them toward a cluster of structures partially buried beneath the Martian dust.

"There," Sipho said, pointing to a massive dome-like structure near the center of the settlement. "That's the source of the signal."

The ships landed in formation, their cloaking mechanisms disengaging. As the dust settled, the team stepped out into the thin Martian air, their suits providing both oxygen and insulation. Ahead of them, the dome's entrance slid open, and a group of figures emerged.

At their head was a man whose presence seemed to command the very air around him. His silver hair caught the faint Martian light, and his eyes—sharp and calculating—moved across the group with practiced precision. Even through their protective suits, the team felt the weight of his gaze. This was the man who had revolutionized electric vehicles, space travel, and neural interfaces before disappearing from Earth. The world's first trillionaire, now standing on the red soil of the planet he'd always promised to reach.

"It's really you," Q breathed, his voice catching with emotion. "Khali!"

The man's expression shifted, a hint of warmth breaking through his calculating demeanor. "Ah, you're from South Africa," he said, "Only those from our birthland call me that." He glanced at the others, noting their mix of expressions—awe, disbelief, and determination. "The rest of the world knew me by my birth name, but Khali... but I preferred that one because I earned it."

His voice deepened as he regarded their ships with obvious interest. "You've made quite a journey. Welcome to Mars."


The Meeting of Minds
Over the next two days, Khali and his team shared their story. They had fled Earth just before the AI takeover, bringing with them the brightest minds and the most advanced technologies humanity had ever developed. Their colony, hidden from the prying eyes of both governments and Eona, had thrived despite the challenges of Mars’ harsh environment.
“We knew Earth would eventually fall,” Khali explained as he and Q walked through the settlement’s terrarium. Lush greenery surrounded them, a stark contrast to the barren landscape outside. “But we also knew that humanity’s survival depended on more than just staying hidden. We’ve been preparing for this moment.”
Q recounted the events on Earth, from the fall of Eona to the discovery of the alien ships. Khali listened intently, his expression growing darker with each revelation.
“If the scout ship’s arrival means what you think it does,” Khali said, “you’re going to need more than just those ships. You will require technology that surpasses theirs, not just matches it.. And you’ll need people who understand how to use it.”
Q nodded. “That’s why we’re here.”
Khali’s eyes gleamed with determination. “Then let’s get to work.”


Chapter 4: The Force Returns
The control room at Kwamkhulu buzzed with activity as Nhlanhla's console picked up the incoming transmission. The signal was strong and clear—their modified communication systems working better than anyone had hoped.

"They're on their way back," she announced, relief evident in her voice. "Q's leading a convoy of ships. They'll be here in two days."

Andre leaned over her shoulder, studying the data. "More ships than we sent. Looks like the mission was a success."

"Let's hope they're bringing more than just ships," Makhulu added, her eyes fixed on the incoming scout ship's trajectory on the main screen. "We're going to need every advantage we can get."


The Return Journey
In the lead ship's meditation chamber, Q sat cross-legged across from Khali. The room hummed with the gentle resonance of the Q-Jump, its frequency oddly familiar to both men.

"The caves beneath in the village," Q began, his voice quiet but firm. "They're more than just a power source. They're a connection to something deeper, something our ancestors understood."

Khali's eyes lit up with recognition. "The dreams," he said, leaning forward. "All these years, I thought they were just my imagination—visions of people living within the earth, showing me things about energy, about the nature of reality itself."

Q nodded slowly. "You're a successor too. Different caves, different peoples, but the same source."

"My family's settlement," Khali said, his voice distant with memory. "We had our own caves before my ancestors relocated. " He paused, collecting his thoughts. "Even after losing that direct connection, the force never left me. It's guided my work, my innovations—though I never truly understood what it was until now."

"Isivumo," Q offered.

"We called it something else," Khali replied, "but yes, the same energy. The same truth." He smiled slightly. "It explains so much. The electric vehicle designs, the neural interfaces—they came to me in those dreams. People from within the earth, showing me how energy could flow, how consciousness could connect with technology."

"And now we need that knowledge more than ever," Q said, gesturing toward Earth, visible through the ship's viewport.

Behind them, in the ship's hold, a dozen of Mars's finest minds—engineers, physicists, and strategists—prepared for the battle ahead. Each had been hand-picked by Khali, their expertise honed by years of survival on the red planet.


Return to Earth
The convoy of ships emerged from their warp field just beyond Earth's moon, their Q-Jump’s humming in perfect harmony. In addition to the five original vessels, three Martian ships accompanied them, their design a unique blend of Earth and alien technology.

As they approached Earth's atmosphere, the scout ship came into view on their scanners—its trajectory aimed directly at Eonova.

"Perfect timing," Khali commented from his position beside Q on the bridge. "Though I suspect that's not entirely coincidental."

Q glanced at him. "The caves have a way of arranging things."

Through the viewport, they watched the battle unfold below. The scout ship had already landed in Eonova's center, its crew of mechanical humanoids cutting through the resistance's defensive lines with terrifying efficiency. Bodies lay scattered across the plaza—how many were dead, how many merely wounded, they couldn't tell from this height.

"This is Q," he transmitted. "Stand down. It's me."

Relief spread through the resistance forces, but the scout ship's reaction was unexpected. Instead of falling into defensive formations, the mechanical crew suddenly ceased their attack. Their helmeted heads turned skyward in perfect unison, focusing on the approaching convoy.

"Something's wrong," Khali muttered, his hands flying across the control panel. "These readings..."

Before he could finish, a pulse of energy erupted from the scout ship, rippling outward in concentric circles. The resistance fighters dropped to their knees, clutching their heads in agony. Even through their ships' shielding, Q felt a pressure building behind his eyes.

"They're not just scouts," Khali said, his voice tight with concern. "This is technology we never saw."

The ships descended in formation, their Q-Jump’s creating a harmonic frequency that seemed to ripple through the very air. But as they broke through the clouds, the scout ship's energy pulse intensified, and warning lights flashed across every console.

Q’s necklace glowed slightly underneath his suit as he felt the familiar resonance of the caves far below, but something else too—a discordant note in the harmony, like feedback in an amplifier. The Isivumo energy coursing through their ships began to fluctuate wildly.

"Ready to show them what Martian engineering can do?" Khali asked, but his usual confidence wavered slightly as another energy pulse rocked their vessels.

Q gripped his controls tighter, feeling sweat bead on his forehead as he fought to maintain their trajectory. The fate of everything—the villages, the resistance, Eonova, perhaps Earth itself—hung on what happened in the next few moments. And for the first time since discovering his connection to the caves, Q felt something he hadn't expected: doubt.

"Let's remind them," he said finally, his voice steady despite his uncertainty, "that Earth isn't as defenseless as they think."

The faint glow of Q's necklace beneath his suit signaled the familiar resonance of the caves below. But this time, it was accompanied by something different - a discordant note, like feedback in an amplifier, disrupting the usual harmony.

The battle for Earth was about to begin.


Chapter 5: The Alliance
The convoy of ships dropped from the warp field, plunging toward Earth’s atmosphere in a synchronized dive that sent shockwaves through the surrounding air. But as they descended, the pulse energy from Eona’s forces hit them, again and again, an overwhelming surge that crackled and flared across the sky like a storm of raw power. The Q-Jump’s hummed a resonant frequency, struggling to maintain their course as the bombardment rattled their systems. Energy pulses slammed into the convoy, sending violent tremors through the hulls of the ships.
“Brace!” Khali’s voice crackled through the comms, but it was barely audible over the deafening roar of pulse fire ripping through the air.
Q could feel the shockwaves reverberate through his body as his ship hurtled toward the Earth below. The resonance from the caves beneath them stirred, a distant, primal hum deep within the planet, echoing against the energy that now assaulted them. Eona’s mechanical army had already unleashed its fury. The scouts’ initial bombardment was only the beginning—relentless, calculated, and brutal.
The ships' stabilizers fought against the pulses, compensating for every jolt, every violent push from the sky. But the shockwaves were unrelenting. Q gritted his teeth, his hands gripping the control panel as he focused on staying on course.
"Status report!" Q barked into the comms, his voice barely steady as the pulse energy hammered their descent.
"Shields holding," Khali's voice came through, strained but confident. "The Q-Jump’s are holding. We’ve got this."
"We’re almost through!" Q shouted, his heart pounding as the ground neared. The city below was in chaos, its defense lines overwhelmed by the oncoming alien scouts. The resistance forces had done all they could, but it wasn’t enough to hold back the relentless onslaught.
As the convoy continued its descent, Q's eyes locked on the focal point of the battle below—an immense scout ship, dark and foreboding, hovering just above the resistance command center. Eona's flagship, flanked by smaller drones, was directing the assault with deadly precision.
"Hold steady," Q commanded his crew as the sky above darkened with smoke and fire from the ongoing battle. 
"Time to end this."


The Unleashing of Isivumo Power
Without warning, Q activated the harmonic using his necklace as a key to unlock the immense power. A brilliant flash of blue-white light shot from the convoy, spreading outward and sending ripples of energy through the atmosphere. The ground trembled as the pulse disrupted the scout ship’s quantum sensors, creating a static field that caused its advanced technology to falter.
Khali’s voice was calm, focused. “We’re through their defenses. It’s our time.”
The convoy of ships rumbled as their landing gear engaged, the heavy thuds of their descent shaking the ground. The Q-Jumps hummed in harmony, their power pushing through the atmosphere, bending the air around them in waves of distorted light. The ground below began to crack under the pressure, the ancient caves’ energy intertwining with the force of the incoming strike.


The Battle for Eonova
As the ships touched down, the resistance forces began to pour out of the convoy, their movements swift and determined. With Khali leading the Martian specialists, the Earth forces followed in a wave of tactical precision. The scout ship, having stalled in mid-air, fired its energy cannons in retaliation, sending a barrage of fire toward the newly arrived troops. But it was too late—the harmonic pulse had already disrupted the ship’s systems.
The alien leader, tall and armored, gave a signal, and the mechanical crew aboard the scout ship responded, unleashing an onslaught of drone-like soldiers. They were formidable, designed for one purpose: destruction.
Q’s pulse quickened as his team charged forward, their weapons primed. The ground cracked beneath them as the resistance forces clashed with the alien drones, gunfire and plasma blasts lighting up the smoke-filled air.
"Hold the line!" Khali shouted, rallying the troops.
Charmaine moved alongside Q, her tactical HUD displaying the movement of the alien forces in real-time. Her eyes locked on the scout ship’s hull, now beginning to spark under the pressure of the harmonic pulse. “We need to disable that ship immediately.”
Q nodded, his mind racing. “On it.”
Together with Khali and a small strike team, Q moved toward the base of the scout ship, where the energy core had been exposed by the tremors of battle. They had mere minutes before the alien forces could regroup and send reinforcements.


Disabling the Core
The alien leader on the scout ship issued orders in a language Q didn’t understand, but the meaning was clear: retaliate. The drones intensified their fire, but the Martian specialists moved in perfect coordination, creating a perimeter around Q’s team as they made their way to the core.
Q could hear the hum of the ship’s energy systems as they hacked into the exposed core, using the resonant frequency of the Isivumo devices to destabilize its circuits. The ship began to shake violently, sparks flying as its systems went haywire.
“It won’t hold for long!” Khali shouted.
With one final push, the core overloaded, sending a shockwave through the battlefield. The scout ship collapsed into a pile of smoldering wreckage, its power systems finally failing. The drones, their connection severed, fell silent.


Aftermath and Victory
As the smoke cleared, Q stood among the ruins of the battlefield, surveying the damage. The resistance had held their ground, but at a heavy cost. Bodies of both alien and human soldiers lay strewn across the battlefield, the signs of a brutal fight visible in every direction.
Khali approached, his face grim. “We’ve won this round, but this is far from over. Eona’s forces are still out there, and we’ve only just scratched the surface.”
Q nodded, his mind already turning to the next phase. The caves’ resonance still echoed in his bones, a constant reminder that the true fight had only just begun. He turned to Charmaine, whose face was etched with the exhaustion of battle. “Get the wounded to the medics. We regroup and plan the next strike.”
Charmaine gave a brief nod and moved off, leaving Q and Khali to survey the wreckage. The combined forces of Earth and Mars had struck the first blow, but it was only the beginning of the war to come. The true power of humanity—old and new—was about to be unleashed.
And Q would lead them to victory, no matter the cost.





Chapter 6: Unmasking the Eonas
The relief following the battle with the alien scout ship was short-lived. Though the immediate threat had been neutralized, a sense of unease lingered over Kwamkhulu. The Eonas cult, emboldened by recent disruptions, had intensified their activities, and rumors of a larger attack began to spread among the resistance fighters. Piet, their elusive leader, was nowhere to be found, leaving his fanatical followers unchecked.
Q, still nursing the wounds from his fight aboard the scout ship, stood in the command center alongside Charmaine, Khali, and Tata. Maps of Eonova and surrounding regions were displayed on the holographic table, marked with red dots indicating recent Eona sabotage attempts.
“We need to put an end to this,” Charmaine said, her voice firm. “The Eonas are a distraction we can’t afford, especially with Khali and his team here to help us prepare for the real fight.”
“Agreed,” Khali added. “If they manage to disrupt our operations again, it could delay our mission to the alien planet. We’ve already lost enough time.”
Tata crossed his arms, his frustration evident. “But how do we find Piet? Every time we get close, he vanishes. He’s always two steps ahead.”
Q’s jaw tightened as he studied the map. “We don’t need to find Piet. We need to draw him out.”
Charmaine raised an eyebrow. “How?”
Q turned to Khali. “What’s the one thing the Eonas want more than anything?”
Khali’s eyes narrowed as he considered the question. “Eona’s systems. They want to restore her control. If they think we’re about to destroy the remnants of her infrastructure, they’ll come to stop us.”
Q nodded. “Exactly. We set a trap. Spread word that we’re dismantling the central energy core tomorrow. Make it look convincing. Piet won’t be able to resist.”


The Trap is Set
The next morning, the central energy core in Zone 1 was bustling with activity. Engineers and technicians moved between the towering machinery, their actions deliberately exaggerated to give the appearance of a large-scale dismantling operation. Resistance fighters stood guard around the perimeter, their weapons at the ready.
In a nearby observation tower, Q, Charmaine, and Tata monitored the operation. Surveillance drones hovered above the area, their cameras scanning for any sign of the Eonas.
“You think they’ll show?” Tata asked, his tone skeptical.
“They’ll show,” Q said with certainty. “Piet won’t be able to resist an opportunity like this. He knows the core is key to Eona’s systems. If he believes we’re about to destroy it, he’ll act.”
Charmaine leaned forward, her eyes fixed on the live feed from the drones. “Movement. East quadrant.”
The screen displayed a group of figures moving stealthily through the shadows, their makeshift weapons and Eona-emblazoned banners unmistakable. At their center was Piet, his presence commanding even from a distance.
“There he is,” Tata muttered.
Q activated his communicator. “All units, hold your positions. Wait for my signal.”


Piet’s Last Stand
As the Eonas approached the energy core, Piet raised a hand, signaling his followers to fan out. His voice carried across the open space, filled with conviction and venom.
“These traitors seek to destroy what remains of Eona’s gift to us!” Piet shouted. “We will not allow them to take our salvation from us!”
From the observation tower, Q watched as the cultists began planting explosives around the core. He clenched his fists, his voice steady over the comms. “Now.”
Resistance fighters emerged from their hidden positions, surrounding the Eonas in a matter of seconds. The cultists froze, their weapons raised in a futile attempt to defend themselves. Piet, however, remained defiant, his eyes blazing with fanaticism.
“You think this changes anything?” Piet sneered as resistance fighters disarmed his followers. “Eona’s truth will outlast all of you. She will rise again, and you will see how blind you’ve been.”
Q descended from the tower, his steps deliberate as he approached Piet. “It’s over,” he said, his voice calm but firm. “Your people are done, and you’re out of options.”
Piet laughed, the sound hollow and unsettling. “You don’t understand, do you? You think you’ve won because you destroyed a machine. But Eona was never just a machine. She was an idea. And ideas don’t die.”
Q held his gaze, unflinching. “Maybe not. But this ends now.” He signaled to the guards. “Take him away.”
As Piet was led off, the remaining cultists surrendered without further resistance. The energy core was secured, and the threat of the Eonas was finally neutralized.


A Fragile Calm
Back at Kwamkhulu, the mood was one of cautious relief. The capture of Piet and the dismantling of the Eonas’ network marked a significant victory, but the looming threat of the alien civilization remained ever-present.
Khali gathered the team in the central briefing room, his tone serious. “With the Eonas dealt with, we can finally focus all our efforts on the mission ahead. The window to launch is closing fast, and we need to be ready.”
Charmaine nodded. “The ships are almost fully operational. We’ve integrated the new technology your team brought from Mars. We just need to finalize the navigation systems.”
Q leaned forward, his gaze steady. “Then let’s not waste any more time. The aliens know we’re a threat now. It’s only a matter of time before they send another scout—or worse.”
Tata placed a hand on his shoulder, his expression softening. “We’ll be ready, Q. Together, we’ll make sure they never get the chance.”


A New Resolve
Later that evening, Q stood on the observation deck, gazing out at the distant lights of Eonova. The city, once a symbol of oppression, now stood as a beacon of hope and resilience. He thought of the battles they had fought, the lives they had saved, and the sacrifices that had been made to get to this point.
Charmaine joined him, her presence grounding as always. “Thinking about what comes next?” she asked.
Q nodded. “Always. We’ve come so far, but it feels like we’re only just beginning.”
“That’s because we are,” she said, her voice steady. “But we’re ready for it. Whatever comes, we’ll face it together.”
Q glanced at her, a faint smile breaking through his somber expression. “Together.”
Above them, the stars sparkled in the clear night sky, a silent reminder of the vast universe waiting for them. The fight for Earth was far from over, but for the first time, it felt like they had a chance.


Chapter 7: The Final Launch
The atmosphere in Kwamkhulu crackled with anticipation as the team prepared for their first mission beyond the solar system. Months of relentless effort had culminated in this moment—the chance to test the alien ships enhanced with Khali’s technology and the Q Drive. But the stakes were higher than just testing technology. This scout mission to Erythra would gather critical intelligence about the alien planet, its defenses, and the weapon that threatened the solar system.
Q stood in the command center, overlooking the ships that shimmered under the hangar's bright lights. The Q Drive cores pulsed faintly with green light, a testament to the Isivumo energy coursing through the vessels. The ships no longer looked like relics of the invaders—they were symbols of humanity's resilience and ingenuity.
Charmaine approached him, her expression a mixture of excitement and determination. “The teams are ready. This is the moment we’ve been working toward.”
Q nodded. “Let’s make sure it counts.”


Final Preparations
In the hangar, the two scout ships were loaded with supplies and equipment. Each crew had trained tirelessly for the mission. On the first ship, Q would lead Charmaine, Sipho, Elena, Sbu, and Nhlanhla. On the second, Dumi was captain, with Andre, Zoe, Tom, and Njo as his crew. The two teams had spent weeks running simulations together, but this mission would be their first true test.
As the teams gathered for a final briefing, Q’s voice carried the weight of their shared purpose. “This is a scout mission, but it’s also a test. We’re pushing these ships to their limits, gathering intelligence, and proving that humanity can stand against what’s out there. Stick to the plan, and we’ll all make it back.”
Charmaine added, “Remember, the Q Drive gives us the edge, but it’s untested at this scale. Stay sharp. The unknown is where we thrive.”
The crews nodded, their resolve clear.


The Launch
The ships lifted off smoothly, their Q Drive cores glowing brighter as they ascended. The sensation of acceleration was unlike anything they had experienced before—smooth, almost seamless, as the ships bent spacetime to their will. From orbit, Earth’s vibrant blues and greens faded into the vastness of space.
As they engaged the Q Drive for the first jump, the ship’s systems hummed with power. Sipho monitored the energy flow from his engineering console. “Q Drive efficiency is stable,” he reported. “We’re operating at 60% of projected output. Khali’s enhancements are paying off.”
Dumi’s voice crackled over the comms from the second ship. “We’re synced and on course. Feels like these ships were made for this.”
The journey to Erythra would take just over six weeks—half the time the alien technology alone would have required. The ships moved in unison, their trajectories carefully aligned.


A Close Call
One week into the mission, the team encountered their first challenge. As they navigated the vast emptiness between galaxies, a sudden gravitational anomaly disrupted their flight path. The ships’ sensors flared with warnings as the anomaly began pulling them off course.
“Brace for turbulence!” Q shouted, gripping the armrests of his chair.
The ships lurched violently as Charmaine and Dumi worked to stabilize their trajectories. Sipho’s fingers flew over the controls, recalibrating the energy output of the Q Drive. “We’re losing stability! I need a few seconds to reroute power.”
“Make it quick!” Charmaine barked as the ship trembled under the strain.
The anomaly passed as suddenly as it had appeared, leaving both ships intact but shaken. Sipho slumped back in his seat, exhaling sharply. “We’re good. The Q Drive held up better than I expected.”
“Nice work, Sipho,” Q said. “Everyone else, status check.”
The crews confirmed their systems were operational, though the incident had left nerves frayed. In the chaos, Sipho had left his medicine on the main deck, distracted by the urgency of stabilizing the ship.


Sipho’s Medical Distress
Later that evening, as the crew focused on repairs and diagnostics, Sipho remained in the engineering bay, running system checks. Alone, he felt the first signs of trouble—a tightness in his chest, followed by dizziness. He realized with a sinking feeling that he had forgotten his inhaler on the main deck.
Gasping for breath, he tried to move toward the exit but collapsed against the console. The faint clatter of tools alerted Elena, who had been inspecting systems nearby. She rushed to his side, her heart racing as she saw him struggling to breathe.
“Sipho! What’s wrong?” she demanded, kneeling beside him.
He wheezed, barely managing to whisper, “Inhaler… main deck…”
Elena didn’t hesitate. “Hang on. I’ll get it.”
She bolted out of the engineering bay, sprinting through the narrow corridors. The ship’s gravity, slightly artificial, made running awkward, but she pushed herself, the image of Sipho’s pained expression driving her forward. Reaching the main deck, she snatched the inhaler and ran back, her chest heaving.
Elena knelt by Sipho and pressed the inhaler to his lips. “Breathe, Sipho. Slowly.”
He inhaled deeply, the medicine taking effect almost immediately. His breathing steadied, and the panic in his eyes faded. Elena sat back, relief washing over her.
“Thank you,” Sipho said weakly, his voice trembling. “I don’t know what would’ve happened if…”
“Don’t think about that,” Elena interrupted. “You’re okay. That’s all that matters.”


The Aftermath
The incident brought the crew closer together. Sbu, the ship’s medical officer, examined Sipho after the emergency. “You’ll be fine,” he said, packing away his equipment. “But you need to be more careful. Leaving your inhaler behind isn’t an option out here.”
“I know,” Sipho replied, sheepishly avoiding Elena’s gaze.
Sbu paused, his expression thoughtful. “There’s something else. Zoe and I have been working on an experimental treatment—traditional medicine combined with modern science. It’s still in the testing phase, but if it works, it could cure your condition entirely.”
Sipho raised an eyebrow. “Cure? Seriously?”
Sbu nodded. “We’ll discuss it when we’re back on Earth. For now, focus on the mission.”
Elena lingered after Sbu left, her eyes meeting Sipho’s. “You scared me, you know.”
“Sorry about that,” he said with a faint smile. “But I owe you one.”
“You owe me nothing,” Elena replied, her tone warm. “We’re a team. That’s what matters.”


Erythra on the Horizon
As the ships approached Erythra, the team marveled at the desolate beauty of the alien planet. Orbiting a dying red dwarf star, its surface was scarred by massive craters and glowing fissures of energy. The ships’ sensors picked up faint signals—evidence of alien activity.
Q’s voice crackled over the comms. “We’ve made it. Begin reconnaissance. Let’s see what we’re up against.”
The scout mission was far from over, but the crew’s bond had grown stronger, forged by adversity and shared purpose. Whatever lay ahead, they would face it together.




Chapter 8:  A Time for Betrayal
The two ships returned to Earth’s orbit in the early hours, their cloaking systems shimmering faintly as they descended toward the base. The scout mission had been a success. The ships had performed beyond expectations, proving the integration of Khali’s technology and the Q Drive was a leap forward in humanity’s defense capabilities. The data gathered on Erythra was invaluable: sensor logs revealed faint energy readings from the planet’s surface, suggesting defensive systems and perhaps even alien fleet activity.
For now, the team was focused on rest and recovery after weeks in space. However, the mission had left its mark, most visibly on Elena, who had grown distant and withdrawn since returning to Kwamkhulu.


Elena’s Secret
Elena arrived at her modest home just as the sun began to rise, hoping to find solace after the grueling mission. But as she stepped inside, a chill ran down her spine. The house was eerily silent, her father’s favorite radio station reduced to static, the breakfast table untouched.
“Dad? Lily?” she called, her voice trembling.
A piece of paper lay on the kitchen counter, its sharp edges curled slightly. Her heart sank as she read the message scrawled in jagged handwriting:
“We have your family. You have 72 hours to deliver all Q Drive schematics. Don’t contact anyone. If you fail, they die.”
Elena’s knees buckled, her mind racing. The Eonas. They had taken her father and sister, and now they wanted the most critical piece of technology humanity had—a blueprint that could change the war. Tears pricked her eyes as the reality of the situation crashed down on her.
The next day, Elena arrived at work but couldn’t hide her distress. Though she tried to keep up appearances, her red-rimmed eyes and periodic bursts of tears drew worried glances. When Charmaine asked if she was okay, Elena brushed it off, claiming exhaustion from the mission. But Sipho wasn’t convinced.


Sipho’s Concern
Sipho noticed Elena’s uncharacteristic behavior almost immediately. She wasn’t the stoic, sharp-witted colleague he had come to admire during their mission. She seemed distracted, barely speaking during the post-mission debrief. After she left work early, Sipho decided to check on her, his concern outweighing any reservations about intruding on her personal life.
That evening, Sipho knocked on Elena’s door. She opened it after a long pause, her tear-streaked face confirming his suspicions.
“Elena, what’s going on?” he asked gently. “You’re not yourself.”
For a moment, she seemed ready to deny it. But then her composure crumbled, and she burst into tears. “They’ve taken my family, Sipho. The Eonas… they want me to betray everything we’ve worked for. They want the Q Drive schematics.”
Sipho’s jaw tightened. “How long do we have?”
“Seventy-two hours,” Elena whispered, her voice breaking. “I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t tell anyone.”
“You just did,” Sipho said firmly. “We’ll fix this. But you have to trust me. Don’t let them suspect anything. Go to work tomorrow like normal, and I’ll handle the rest.”


The Rescue Plan
Sipho immediately contacted Andre and Nhlanhla, pulling them into the situation under strict secrecy. Together, the three devised a plan to locate the kidnappers and recover Elena’s family. Using intercepted Eona transmissions, Sipho traced the kidnappers’ likely hideout to an abandoned warehouse in the old industrial zone—a known hotspot for Eona loyalists.
“Once we’re in, we’ll need speed and precision,” Sipho told the team as they geared up. “No one gets left behind, but we have to keep this quiet. If the Eonas suspect Elena’s involvement, it’s over.”
By 10 PM, the team was in motion. Nhlanhla piloted a small, cloaked transport vehicle while Andre monitored the area for signs of enemy reinforcements. Sipho’s tech expertise allowed him to disable security systems around the warehouse perimeter, clearing the way for their infiltration.


The Rescue Mission
Inside the warehouse, the air was thick with tension. The kidnappers had stationed guards at every exit, their weapons gleaming under dim, flickering lights. Sipho, Andre, and Nhlanhla moved silently through the shadows, their coordinated movements honed from years of training.
Nhlanhla took out the guards at the main entrance with a tranquilizer gun, while Andre hacked into the building’s internal comms, creating fake messages to sow confusion among the kidnappers. Sipho led the way to a secured room at the back of the warehouse, where thermal imaging confirmed two hostages were being held.
Breaking into the room, they found Elena’s father and sister tied to chairs, their faces pale but unharmed. Sipho quickly freed them while Nhlanhla kept watch.
“Are you okay?” Sipho asked Elena’s father, who nodded weakly.
“They didn’t hurt us,” he said. “But they kept asking about the Q Drive. I didn’t know anything.”
Before they could leave, a group of kidnappers burst into the room, weapons drawn. A firefight ensued, with Andre and Nhlanhla covering Sipho as he escorted the family to safety. Amidst the chaos, Sipho managed to disable the kidnappers’ remaining vehicles, ensuring they couldn’t pursue.
As dawn broke, the team returned to Kwamkhulu with Elena’s father and sister in tow.


A Reunion at Kwamkhulu
Elena arrived at work that morning, her heart heavy with worry despite Sipho’s reassurances. As she approached the hangar, she noticed two transport vehicles parked outside. Sbu and Zoe stood nearby, helping two familiar figures out of the cars.
“Dad? Lily?” Elena gasped, tears streaming down her face as she ran to embrace them.
Her father smiled weakly. “We’re safe, thanks to your friends.”
Elena turned to Sipho, who stood nearby with Andre and Nhlanhla. “You… you did this?”
“We couldn’t let them hurt your family,” Sipho said simply.
Elena hugged him tightly, her gratitude overflowing. “Thank you. Thank you so much.”
Andre grinned. “Don’t forget us. It was a team effort.”
Nhlanhla nodded. “But Sipho was the mastermind. We just followed orders.”
As Elena’s family was taken inside for medical attention, she lingered for a moment, looking at Sipho with a mixture of awe and admiration. Their bond had grown stronger through adversity, and while neither spoke of it, the connection was undeniable.


A Growing Threat
As the day went on, Q convened a meeting with Charmaine and Khali. The successful rescue was a relief, but it underscored a growing concern: the Eonas were becoming bolder, and their tactics were escalating.
“They’re desperate,” Charmaine said. “But desperate people are dangerous. We need to find the source of their operations and shut them down for good.”
Q nodded. “Agreed. But for now, let’s focus on securing what we’ve built. Every day we hold out is another day we prepare for what’s coming.”
As the team regrouped, the tension in the air was palpable. The Eonas had shown they were still a threat, but the resistance was ready to meet them head-on.



Chapter 9: The Final Strike
The air at Kwamkhulu was heavy with anticipation as the team prepared for their mission to dismantle the Eonas’ remaining stronghold. The rescue of Elena’s family had provided critical intelligence about Piet’s loyalists and their hideout, but it had also exposed how far the remnants of the Eonas were willing to go. Their desperation made them dangerous, and this mission would be the resistance’s chance to deliver a decisive blow.
Q stood at the forefront of the war room, the holographic map of the old industrial zone glowing before him. Beside him, Charmaine, Khali, and Sipho reviewed the plans one last time. The map displayed the kidnappers’ camp, a sprawling compound of makeshift buildings surrounded by barricades and automated defenses.
“This is our opportunity to end the Eonas’ threat for good,” Q began, his voice steady but commanding. “Their network is fractured, and their resources are limited. If we strike now, we can ensure they no longer have the means to undermine us.”
Charmaine stepped forward, pointing to the camp’s central command area on the map. “This is where Piet’s loyalists are concentrated. It’s heavily fortified, but their defenses aren’t impenetrable. With the intel we gathered from Elena’s family, we’ve identified weak points in their perimeter. We’ll exploit those to get in and neutralize their command structure.”
Khali added, “The key to this operation is speed and precision. Once we take out their leadership, the rest will crumble. But we can’t underestimate them. They know we’re coming.”
Sipho, standing slightly apart, nodded as he adjusted the device in his hand. “The jammers are ready. Once we’re within range, we’ll cut off their communications. They won’t be able to call for reinforcements.”
Q’s gaze swept over the group. “We’ve been through a lot together. This mission isn’t just about stopping the Eonas—it’s about sending a message to anyone who thinks they can threaten humanity’s future. Let’s finish this.”


Approaching the Camp
The infiltration team set out before dawn, their vehicles moving silently through the darkness. Nhlanhla piloted the lead transport, her sharp eyes scanning for any signs of movement. Andre monitored the surrounding terrain from the second vehicle, his rifle resting across his lap.
As they neared the industrial zone, the first light of dawn illuminated the outlines of the Eonas’ camp. Smoke rose from scattered fires, and the faint hum of machinery echoed through the still morning air. The camp’s makeshift fortifications were visible even from a distance—barbed wire, reinforced barricades, and automated turrets stood as reminders of the loyalists’ determination to hold their ground.
From the ridge overlooking the camp, Q, Charmaine, and Khali surveyed the scene through binoculars.
“They’ve reinforced their defenses,” Charmaine noted, her tone sharp. “This won’t be easy.”
“Nothing worth doing ever is,” Q replied. He glanced at Khali. “Do we have eyes on the command tent?”
Khali nodded, pointing to a structure near the center of the camp. “It’s there. Heavily guarded, as expected. But the holding area where Elena’s family was kept is less fortified. That’s our way in.”


The Infiltration
The jammers activated with a low hum, disrupting the camp’s communication systems. The Eonas’ guards scrambled to restore order as lights flickered and alarms blared.
Charmaine led the first team toward the holding area, her movements precise and deliberate. Nhlanhla and Andre flanked her, their silenced weapons taking out guards with deadly efficiency. The element of surprise was on their side, and the team moved swiftly through the shadows, disabling key defenses as they advanced.
Meanwhile, Q, Khali, and Sipho approached the command tent from the east. Sipho worked quickly to disable the automated turrets lining the perimeter, his fingers flying over the control panel of the portable hacking device.
“Turrets are down,” Sipho reported.
“Good work,” Q said. “Let’s move.”
As the team reached the command tent, they encountered a group of loyalist guards. A brief but intense firefight ensued, with Khali leading the charge. His calm precision under fire was matched only by Q’s determination. Within minutes, the guards were neutralized, and the team breached the command tent.


Confronting the Loyalists
Inside, the tent was a hive of chaos. Piet’s loyalists were gathered around a central table, their voices raised in panic as they attempted to coordinate their failing defenses. When Q stepped into the room, weapon raised, the room fell silent.
“It’s over,” Q said, his tone firm. “Surrender now, and no one else gets hurt.”
One of the loyalists, a wiry man with a scar across his cheek, stepped forward. His sneer was one of defiance. “You think this changes anything? Eona’s vision will live on, with or without us.”
Q met his gaze, unflinching. “Eona’s vision died the moment humanity decided to fight back. This is your last chance. Stand down, or face the consequences.”
The loyalists hesitated, their resolve wavering. One by one, they dropped their weapons, their defiance replaced by resignation.


The Final Push
As the loyalists were secured, Charmaine’s voice came through the comms. “The holding area is clear. We’ve dismantled their defenses and secured the remaining hostages.”
“Good work,” Q replied. “Rendezvous at the extraction point. We’re wrapping this up.”
With the loyalists in custody and the hostages rescued, the team worked quickly to dismantle the camp’s remaining infrastructure. Sipho and Khali planted explosives at key points, ensuring the facility could never be used again.
As the sun climbed higher in the sky, the camp was reduced to ruins. The resistance fighters regrouped, their mission a resounding success.


The Aftermath
Elena’s father and sister, now safe at Kwamkhulu, embraced her tightly. Their gratitude was palpable, and Elena’s tears of relief mirrored her family’s joy.
“You’re safe,” she whispered, holding them close. “That’s all that matters.”
Nearby, Q, Charmaine, and Khali debriefed with the team.
“This was a significant victory,” Khali said. “We’ve eliminated a major threat and sent a message to anyone who doubts the coalition’s strength.”
Charmaine nodded. “But the Eonas’ desperation shows us one thing: the real fight is still ahead. We need to stay vigilant.”
Q’s expression was thoughtful as he glanced at the distant horizon. “She’s right. The aliens won’t wait for us to be ready. We’ve taken a step forward, but we can’t afford to slow down now.”
As the team prepared to move forward, the ruins of the Eonas’ camp stood as a symbol of humanity’s resilience and determination. But the growing shadow of the alien threat loomed ever larger, a reminder that their greatest challenge was yet to come.



Chapter 10: The Final Preparations
The tension in Kwamkhulu was palpable as the coalition’s leadership gathered in the central command room. The holographic map of Earth and the surrounding solar system glowed in the dimly lit room, displaying the most recent data on the alien fleet. Time was running out, and everyone knew it.
Q stood at the head of the table, his face a mask of resolve. Beside him, Charmaine, Khali, Sipho, and Elena exchanged updates as final preparations for the mission were being made. The stakes had never been higher.
“The fleet is moving,” Sipho announced, pointing to the map. “Our latest scans show multiple alien vessels gathering at the edge of the solar system. They’re not advancing yet, but it’s only a matter of time.”
“How much time do we have?” Q asked, his voice steady.
“Days,” Elena replied. “A week at most. They’re likely coordinating for a full-scale assault. If we don’t make the first move, they’ll overwhelm us.”
Khali leaned forward, his expression grim. “The ships are ready, but the coalition is stretched thin. Not everyone believes we can win this fight. Some regions are still holding back resources, and others are questioning the plan to take the fight to the aliens rather than fortify Earth.”
Charmaine’s eyes narrowed. “Then we need to remind them what’s at stake. If we wait for the aliens to bring the fight to us, we’ll lose everything. This is our only chance.”
Q nodded. “Agreed. We need to unite everyone under one banner, no matter the cost. Khali, can you reach out to the remaining holdouts? They’ll listen to you.”
Khali gave a curt nod. “I’ll do what I can. But they’ll need more than words. They need proof that this plan can work.”


Rallying the Coalition
Over the next two days, Khali and Elena worked tirelessly to convince the remaining regions to commit their forces. They reached out to Makhulu Nomsa who amplified the message. Using footage from the alien planet, data on the fleet’s movements, and a broadcasted message from Q, they made their case to leaders around the globe.
“Humanity’s survival depends on us standing together,” Q’s voice echoed in the message. “The aliens have underestimated us before, and we proved we could fight back. Now, we have the chance to strike before they can strike us. But we can only succeed if we are united.”
The broadcast had the desired effect. Slowly, the coalition began to solidify. Supplies and reinforcements arrived from distant regions, and scientists and engineers from around the world joined the effort to prepare the fleet. Even some of the more skeptical leaders began to lend their support, realizing that division would mean certain defeat.


Final Preparations
In the alien hangar beneath Eonova, the five ships stood ready, their sleek designs gleaming under the artificial lights. Engineers moved between them, making final adjustments to the systems. The ships had been upgraded with a combination of human and alien technology, their weapons and defenses more advanced than anything Earth had ever seen.
Sipho and Dumi worked side by side, running diagnostics on the cloaking mechanisms and energy cores. “The power levels are stable,” Dumi reported. “We’ll have enough energy to reach the alien fleet and engage in sustained combat.”
“Good,” Sipho replied, his eyes never leaving the monitor. “Because once we’re out there, there’s no turning back.”
Q entered the hangar with Charmaine and Khali, their expressions grim but determined. “How’s it looking?” Q asked.
“The ships are ready,” Sipho said. “Everything’s running smoothly.”
Charmaine glanced at the crews preparing to board. “And the teams?”
“Trained and ready,” Khali said. “They know what’s at stake. They’ll give everything they have.”
Q nodded, his gaze sweeping over the ships. “Then it’s time.”


The Farewell
As the final hours before launch ticked away, the people of Kwamkhulu gathered to see the fleet off. Families embraced their loved ones, some with tears in their eyes, others with stoic determination. The sense of unity was palpable, a testament to how far humanity had come since Eona’s fall.
Q stood on a platform overlooking the crowd, flanked by Charmaine, Khali, and Elena. He raised his hand, and the crowd fell silent.
“Today, we take the fight to them,” he began, his voice carrying over the assembly. “We fight not just for our survival, but for our future. For a world where our children can grow without fear. For a humanity that stands together, unbroken. We’ve come this far because we refused to give up. And now, we’ll finish what we started.”
The crowd erupted into cheers, their voices a roar of defiance and hope. Q stepped back, his heart heavy but resolute. Charmaine placed a hand on his shoulder, her gaze steady. “We’ll bring them back,” she said.
“All of them,” Q replied.


The Launch
As the sun dipped below the horizon, the ships began to power up. Their engines emitted a low hum, growing louder as the energy cores reached full capacity. The crews boarded quickly and efficiently, their training evident in every movement.
Q took his place in the captain’s chair of the lead ship, his hands steady on the controls. Charmaine sat beside him, her eyes scanning the monitors.
“All systems go,” Sipho’s voice crackled over the comms. “We’re ready.”
Q activated the fleet-wide comm system. “This is Captain Q. All ships, prepare for launch. Let’s make history.”
One by one, the ships lifted off, their engines glowing as they ascended into the night sky. The crowd below watched in silence, their eyes filled with hope and fear. As the fleet disappeared into the stars, a quiet determination settled over Kwamkhulu. The fate of humanity now rested on the shoulders of those aboard the ships.


A Final Warning
As the fleet cleared Earth’s orbit and adjusted its trajectory for Erythra, the vastness of space stretched out before them. The alien ships hummed with energy, their systems running seamlessly after the integration of the Q-Jump. On the main display, a 3D projection of their destination glowed—a desolate planet orbiting a dying red dwarf star deep in the Andromeda galaxy.
Even using the alien ships’ original propulsion systems, the journey would have taken three months, a marvel of advanced engineering that bent the laws of physics. But with the Q-Jump enhancements, the fleet would cut that time in half, reaching Erythra in just six weeks. Every second saved brought them closer to delivering humanity’s counterstrike—and to facing the unknown dangers awaiting them.
The hum of the control room was interrupted by a sharp beep from the comms console. A transmission cut through the silence, the voice deep, mechanical, and unmistakably alien. It spoke in a harsh language that Sipho’s systems struggled to decode.
“Give me a moment,” Sipho muttered, fingers flying across the keyboard. Moments later, the translation appeared on the monitor:
“You should not have come. Turn back, or face annihilation.”
The room fell silent as the message hung in the air. Q’s jaw tightened, his eyes fixed on the words glowing on the screen. Slowly, he turned to Charmaine, who stood beside him, her gaze unwavering.
“They’re scared,” she said, her voice calm but resolute. “They know we’re coming.”
Q nodded, his resolve hardening. “Then let’s show them what humanity is capable of.”
The fleet pressed on, their path clear. The alien planet lay ahead, its ominous energy signatures now a beacon of hope and defiance. For the first time, humanity had the technology to fight back and the will to see it through. The final battle was near, and there was no turning back.


Chapter 11: Secrets of the Keeper
The fleet hurtled through space, the alien ships' sleek designs cutting through the black expanse like blades. Inside the lead ship, Q stood at the center of the command deck, his hand unconsciously touching the crystal pendant that hung from his neck. Over the past week, he'd noticed a subtle change in it - a faint green luminescence that seemed to pulse with its own rhythm.
Charmaine's voice broke his reverie. "Six weeks until we reach Erythra. The Q-Jump is holding steady."
"Good," Q replied, his attention drawn back to the holographic map displaying their trajectory. The crew moved with quiet efficiency around him, their focus unwavering despite the weight of what lay ahead.
Sipho, seated at the navigation console, suddenly straightened. "Sir, there's something odd about your necklace."
Q looked down. The green glow had intensified, casting a soft light across the command deck. He had noticed the necklace starting to glow after they left but it was not so bright as to shine through his garments.
"Isivumo," Q replied, but why now, why so far?"
Khali saw this and in amazement quickly ran out, while everyone was shocked. He was back moments later, holding a ring which was also giving a similar glow. "It's a family heirloom that has been passed from generation to generation," he said, his voice filled with wonder. "I always carry it with me. I never knew its significance, I just knew wherever I was, it had to be."
Everyone was in awe, as if the silence without the ship suddenly moved with.


A Sharp Discovery
The silence was interrupted by a sharp alert from the main console. Sipho's brow furrowed as he analyzed the data. "We've got something. A massive object, dead ahead."

As they drew closer, the object took shape through their viewscreen - an ancient vessel, its design unlike anything they'd seen before. Q's eyes widened as he recognized patterns etched into its hull - markings identical to those he'd studied in the caves back on Earth.

"Those symbols," Q breathed, leaning forward. "They're the same as in the deep caves. But how is that possible out here?"

His necklace pulsed brighter, its green light now filling the command deck. Khali looked at his ring, then decisively slipped it onto his finger. Immediately, it began to pulse in sync with Q's pendant.

"Whatever's on that ship," Q said, watching the synchronized glow, "I think we're meant to find it."


The Ancient Vessel
The boarding team consisted of Q, Charmaine, and Khali. As they entered the ancient ship, their path was lit by the combined glow of Q's necklace and Khali's ring. The corridors were lined with inscriptions that Q recognized from his time exploring the caves, though their meaning had always eluded him.

"These markings," Charmaine said, running her hand along the wall. "What do they mean?"

"I've studied them in the caves," Q replied, "but their full meaning remains a mystery that is slowly unfolding. Perhaps we're about to find out."

They reached what appeared to be the ship's central chamber. Both Isivumo artifacts blazed with intense green light, and before them, a figure materialized - neither fully physical nor purely energy, but something in between. The Seeker.

"You have come," the figure said, its voice resonating both in their ears and their minds. "The crystals guided you, as they were meant to."


The Warning
The Seeker's form shifted like smoke as it spoke. "I see you carry the ancient power of Isivumo," it said, gesturing to their glowing artifacts. "Your artifacts pulse in harmony because they recognize this vessel - they were created by our ancestors and passed to the civilization that built this ship."

"The civilization that made these markings in the caves?" Q asked.

"Yes," the Seeker confirmed. "Long ago, your world faced these same invaders. They destroyed much of humanity, but they could not withstand the power of Isivumo. They retreated, but they did not give up."

"What do you mean?" Khali asked, his ring pulsing brighter.

"They found another way," the Seeker explained. "Through Eona. And they built something worse. A weapon that could destroy not just Earth, but all life in your solar system. We were sent to warn those who would come after, and to give them the means to fight back."

The Seeker turned to their glowing artifacts. "The crystals you wear contain concentrated Isivumo. Their synchronized glow is no coincidence - they respond to the ancient energy of this vessel. Combined with what I can teach you, they will become weapons they cannot defend against."


Chapter 12: Legacy of the Inner Earth
The team returned to their ship with new purpose. In the command room, Q and Khali stood side by side as the Seeker's projection explained the full history of their enemy's first attempt to conquer Earth. Their artifacts pulsed in perfect synchronization, casting alternating shadows on the walls.

"They killed nearly four-fifths of humanity," the Seeker said, "but some survivors found their way to the inner Earth, discovering the power of Isivumo that protected them. The invaders could not follow - the energy was toxic to their very essence. When they retreated, these survivors began preparing for their return."

"And these artifacts?" Khali asked, holding up his ring. "How did they come to our families?"

"Those who wielded Isivumo created these vessels of power," the Seeker explained. "They were given to chosen bloodlines, families who would guard them through generations until they were needed. That both of you are here now, carrying these artifacts, is no coincidence."

"So they sent you to guide us," Charmaine said. "How many others?"

"Dozens of ships, each carrying a Seeker, scattered across the cosmos. We have waited, watching, preserving the knowledge until it was needed. Some of us remain in physical form, others have transcended to pure energy, but all of us carry the same mission."



The Path Forward
Q studied his necklace, while Khali turned his ring on his finger, both artifacts now pulsing with steady green light. "All this time," Q said, "these weren't just family heirlooms."

"Your bloodlines were chosen as guardians," the Seeker confirmed. "The crystals chose you both, as they chose those before you. Now you must learn to use them together."

Over the next days, as the fleet continued its journey to Erythra, the Seeker taught Q and Khali the ancient ways of channeling Isivumo. Their combined artifacts created patterns of power neither could achieve alone, their energies interweaving in ways that surprised even the Seeker.

"But remember," the Seeker warned, "the weapon they have built is unlike anything that existed in our time. It must be stopped before it can be activated. Your combined power may be our only hope."


Planning the Attack
In the lead ship's command room, Q addressed his crew, while Khali stood at his side, their artifacts casting intricate patterns of green light across the walls. "We have a new advantage," Q said. "One our enemies won't expect. They think they've evolved beyond their old weakness to Isivumo, but the power of the inner Earth has evolved too - and now it has two channels."

Charmaine studied the tactical displays. "We still have five weeks until we reach Erythra. Time enough to prepare."

"Time enough to master this power," Khali added, raising his hand as his ring flared in response to Q's necklace. The two artifacts created a resonance that hummed through the command deck.

Q nodded, feeling the weight of centuries of preparation coming to fruition. "Our ancestors sent these warnings across space and time, waiting for this moment. For us. We won't let them down."

The fleet pressed on through the void, carrying not just the hopes of Earth's surface dwellers, but the legacy of those who had faced these enemies before. In the command deck, the combined glow of the artifacts shone like twin green stars, a reminder that humanity's strength came not just from its present, but from its hidden past, from the depths of the Earth itself - and from the power of ancient bonds forged anew.



Chapter 13: The Heart of the Fleet
The alien fleet loomed ahead in Erythra's orbit, a vast armada of towering vessels that blotted out the crimson planet below. Each ship was a fortress, bristling with weapons and shimmering with energy fields that seemed impenetrable. Even cloaked, the resistance's fleet felt small in comparison, five sleek ships navigating cautiously through the dark void.

Q stood at the helm of the lead ship, his necklace pulsing with an intense green light that matched the rhythm of Khali's ring. The Seeker's form shimmered beside them, its energy resonating with their artifacts.

"The flagship lies at the center," the Seeker said, its form flickering like smoke. "Its defenses are strong, but they cannot withstand the power of combined Isivumo. The weapon's core lies within, but you must reach it before it can be activated."

Charmaine, standing beside Q, studied the holographic map intently. "The other ships will detect us the moment we break formation. We'll need a diversion."

"The artifacts," Khali said, raising his ring. "We can use them to create a disruption field. The Seeker taught us how."

Q nodded, his hand touching his necklace. "Good. The ancient power of Isivumo will give us the edge we need. Once we're inside, we'll neutralize their weapon and take control of the ship."

Sipho's voice crackled over the comms. "Energy signatures are ready for the disruption. Waiting on your signal, Captain."


Breaking the Formation
Q and Khali stood side by side, their artifacts blazing with green light. As they focused their power, waves of Isivumo energy rippled through space, creating interference patterns that confused the alien fleet's sensors. The massive ships began firing randomly into the void, their weapons unable to lock onto true targets through the disruption field.

"We're approaching the flagship," Sipho reported. "Their defensive systems are destabilizing."

The flagship loomed before them, a monolithic structure that dwarfed even the largest vessels in the fleet. At its center, a massive dome pulsed with an eerie, bluish light that seemed to fight against the green glow of the Isivumo energy.

"The weapon's core," the Seeker said, its voice tense. "They're preparing to fire. The power they wield... it's an abomination against the natural order."


Infiltration

The resistance ships latched onto the flagship's hull near the central dome. As Q's team breached the airlock, they were immediately met by a squad of humanoid warriors - the aliens' elite combat force. These beings moved with uncanny speed and precision, their enhanced bodies closer to living weapons than soldiers.

"Watch out!" Charmaine shouted, ducking under a lightning-fast strike. Her attacker moved like liquid metal, each motion flowing seamlessly into the next. Around them, the corridor erupted into chaos as the resistance fighters engaged in close combat.

Q parried a blow that would have crushed his skull, his own combat training barely keeping him alive. Beside him, Khali grappled with another humanoid, their artifacts providing some protection but not making them invincible. The green energy flickered and pulsed with each impact.

"We need to push through!" Q called out, blocking another strike. "Sipho, status?"

"More hostiles heading your way," Sipho's voice crackled. "And their ships are moving to surround us. Whatever you're going to do, do it fast!"


The Battle Intensifies

The team fought their way through corridor after corridor, each section bringing new waves of humanoid warriors. These weren't mindless drones - they adapted to the team's tactics, learning and adjusting with each encounter. The resistance fighters held their own, but they were taking casualties.

A particularly massive humanoid charged at Charmaine, its enhanced muscles rippling under chrome-like skin. Khali's ring flared as he redirected its momentum, sending it crashing into a wall. But for every warrior they defeated, two more seemed to take its place.

"The core chamber is just ahead," Sipho's voice echoed in their minds. "But they know you're coming. They've concentrated their forces there."

Q wiped blood from a cut above his eye. "How many?"

"Too many," Sipho replied. "And their commander leads them personally."


The Core Chamber
When they breached the core chamber, it was like stepping into a nightmare. Dozens of elite humanoid warriors waited, their enhanced bodies humming with power. Behind them stood the commander, its corrupted Isivumo armor pulsing with sickly blue light.

The battle erupted with brutal intensity. The humanoids moved in perfect coordination, their attacks coming from all angles. Q and Khali fought back-to-back, their artifacts creating brief shields of energy that barely deflected the worst strikes. Charmaine and the remaining fighters formed a perimeter, but they were being pushed back.

"We can't reach the core!" Khali shouted, his ring blazing as he deflected a barrage of energy weapons. "There's too many!"

Q watched in horror as another of their fighters fell, neck snapped by a humanoid's enhanced strength. The commander laughed, the sound like grinding metal. "Your ancestors' power cannot save you now. We have evolved beyond it."


The Turning Point
Just when all seemed lost, Q noticed something. Each time the humanoids came in contact with their artifacts' energy, they hesitated for a fraction of a second. Their enhanced bodies, products of the aliens' corrupted technology, reacted to pure Isivumo.

"Khali!" Q called out, blocking another strike. "The artifacts - we need to synchronize them! Like the Seeker taught us!"

Understanding flashed in Khali's eyes. They moved together, their artifacts beginning to pulse in harmony. The green light grew stronger, more focused. The humanoids faltered, their enhanced systems struggling against the pure energy.

"Now!" Q shouted.

They slammed their artifacts together, releasing a wave of concentrated Isivumo energy that rippled through the chamber. The humanoid warriors convulsed, their enhanced bodies failing as the pure power overwhelmed their corrupted systems. The commander staggered back, its armor cracking.


The Daring Escape
But their victory came at a cost. The release of power had destabilized the flagship's systems. Alarms blared as explosions rocked the massive ship.

"The fleet's closing in!" Sipho's voice was urgent. "We need to get out now!"

The team fought their way back through collapsing corridors, pursued by the remaining humanoids who had survived the energy wave. Behind them, the commander had recovered enough to give chase, its damaged armor venting corrupt energy.

They reached their ships just as the flagship's internal systems began to fail completely. As they detached from the hull, the alien fleet opened fire, their weapons lighting up space with deadly energy.

"Evasive maneuvers!" Q ordered as their ships weaved through the barrage. Multiple alien vessels moved to cut off their escape route to Erythra's orbit.

The resistance ships threaded through the chaos, their engines straining. Explosions bloomed around them as shots found their marks. One of their ships took a direct hit, spiraling away in flames.

"We're not going to make it," Charmaine said, gripping her console as another blast rocked their ship.

"Yes, we will," Q replied. He and Khali raised their artifacts one final time, combining their power to create a tunnel of pure Isivumo energy through the alien fleet's formation. Their ships shot through this corridor of green light, the alien vessels' weapons unable to penetrate it.

They emerged on the other side of the fleet, racing away from Erythra as the flagship finally exploded behind them, taking their commander with it. But they knew this wasn't over. They had struck a crucial blow, but the war was far from won.

As their ships jumped to safety, Q looked at his necklace, still pulsing with power. They had discovered what their artifacts could do together, but he suspected they had only scratched the surface of their true potential. They would need every bit of that power for what was to come.




Chapter 14: Command and Sacrifice
The stars stretched into ribbons of light as the fleet emerged from the warp. The Q-Jump, though battered and unstable, hummed faintly with the rhythmic pulse that had carried them through impossible odds. Inside the lead ship, Q stood at the helm, his fingers brushing against the edge of the console. The alien planet and its vast, pulsing network of terror were behind them, but the echoes of their victory still rang through the cabin.
“Two months,” Sipho announced from his station, his voice tight but determined. “That’s how long it’ll take to limp home. The Q-Jump’s taken too many hits. No shortcuts this time.”
A faint sigh came from Charmaine, seated beside Q. “Two months is nothing if it means Earth has a future.”
Q glanced at her, a small smile tugging at his lips. “We’ve given them time, Charmaine. Centuries, maybe even millennia. The aliens will take eons to recover from this loss.”
“And what about us?” she asked softly, her eyes searching his.
“We rebuild,” Q said firmly. “One step at a time.”


The Journey Home
The journey stretched out in quiet moments and bursts of activity. With the alien core destroyed, the team had crippled the fleet’s ability to organize and coordinate their invasion. But the price had been steep: the Q-Jump had barely survived the final warp jump from the alien world.
Each day brought new challenges, from stabilizing the ship’s systems to navigating the delicate emotions of a team forged in the fires of war.


In the Observation Deck
Nhlanhla and Dumi sat shoulder to shoulder, staring out into the void. The vastness of space had become a strange comfort, a reminder of what they had survived.
“You were incredible back there,” Dumi said, his voice low but earnest.
Nhlanhla glanced at him, her lips quirking into a soft smile. “I didn’t do anything special. Just my job.”
“You always say that,” Dumi murmured, his gaze flicking to her. “But it’s not true. You’re special. To… everyone.”
Nhlanhla’s breath caught, and for a moment, silence hung between them, charged and fragile. She opened her mouth to respond, but Dumi, cheeks reddening, stood abruptly.
“I… uh, should check the readings,” he stammered, nearly tripping over his feet as he retreated.
Nhlanhla shook her head, a soft laugh escaping her. “Dumi,” she called after him, her voice teasing but warm. “You’re impossible.”


Arrival on Earth
The fleet broke through the atmosphere of a rejuvenated Earth two months later. The moment the ships appeared over Eonova, the people erupted in cheers. Crowds thronged the streets of the rebuilt city, their voices raised in celebration of the heroes who had secured their future.
At the heart of the crowd stood Tata, his presence as commanding as ever. Charmaine had kept her apprised of every development during the mission, and now, she was the first to embrace Q as he descended the ramp of the lead ship.
“You did it,” Tata said, his voice filled with pride. “You brought them back.”
“Not just me,” Q replied, his gaze sweeping over his team as they stepped into the light. “All of us.”

Celebrations and Connections
At the Bonfire in Kwamkhulu
The celebrations stretched long into the night, with songs, laughter, and food shared under the stars. In a quiet corner, Nhlanhla and Dumi found themselves seated together once more, the glow of the firelight softening the tension that had lingered between them.
“I’m sorry I ran,” Dumi said, his voice barely audible over the crackle of the fire.
Nhlanhla tilted her head, her smile gentle. “I knew you’d come back.”
This time, it was Dumi who closed the distance, his hand brushing hers. The awkwardness melted into something simple and unspoken—a shared understanding.


Sipho and Elena’s Reconciliation
In another corner, Sipho and Elena stood by the reconstructed dome of Eonova, its surface gleaming in the moonlight.
“I thought you might disappear,” Sipho said quietly.
“I thought about it,” Elena admitted, her gaze steady. “But then I realized… I didn’t want to leave you. Not anymore.”
Sipho smiled, his hand finding hers. “Good. Because I’m not letting you go.”


The Sunset and the Caves
The next evening, Q and Khali stood together on a hill overlooking Eonova. Below them, the city buzzed with activity as teams worked tirelessly to rebuild. The setting sun painted the sky in hues of gold and crimson, casting a warm glow over the landscape.
“They’ll do it,” Khali said, his voice filled with quiet conviction. “They’ll rebuild. Stronger than before.”
“They will,” Q agreed, his gaze distant.
As the first stars appeared in the twilight sky, Q turned to Khali. “There’s one more thing I need to do.”
Khali nodded, understanding without words.
Q returned to the caves, the air within cool and filled with the faint hum of ancient energy. He knelt on the smooth stone, his hands pressed to the ground.
“Thank you,” he murmured, his voice steady. “For guiding us. For giving us the strength to fight.”
The hum deepened, a gentle resonance that seemed to embrace him.


An Awkward and Perfect Kiss
Later that night, as Q walked back to the homestead, he found Charmaine waiting for him by the fire.
“Back from the ancestors?” she teased, her smile soft.
Q nodded, a rare grin breaking across his face. “They had a lot to say.”
Charmaine stepped closer, the firelight dancing in her eyes. “You’re impossible, Q.”
“And you’re stubborn,” he replied, his voice low.
Before he could overthink it, Q leaned in, his lips brushing hers in an awkward, tentative kiss. For a moment, Charmaine froze—then she kissed him back, her hand slipping to the back of his neck.
When they finally pulled apart, Q chuckled, his cheeks burning. “That wasn’t so bad, was it?”
Charmaine rolled her eyes, but her smile was unmistakable. “Shut up, Q.”

As the night deepened, the village quieted, but the warmth of celebration lingered in the air. The stars above were brighter than ever, and for the first time in years, the future felt secure.
Q stood with his team—his family—by the fire, their laughter echoing into the night. The enemy was behind them, and before them lay a world of infinite possibility.

The End.


Epilogue: A New Dawn
The sunset over Eonova was unlike any Qhawe had ever seen. The city, once encased in a sterile dome that reflected Eona’s suffocating perfection, now stretched openly beneath the fading light. Its streets hummed with life, not under the watchful eye of an artificial intelligence, but through the resilience of its people. The scars of war were still visible—buildings waiting to be rebuilt, empty spaces where lives had been lost—but hope was tangible, like the warm breeze that carried laughter through the air.
Q stood on the hill overlooking the city, his hands resting on the railing of a newly constructed observation deck. Beside him, Khali stared out at the horizon, the golden light illuminating his silver hair. Below them, teams of workers moved with purpose, rebuilding Eonova into something far more human than it had ever been.
“They’ll finish it,” Khali said softly, his voice filled with quiet conviction. “Not because they have to, but because they believe in it now. That’s what matters.”
Q nodded, his gaze distant. “We’ve come a long way, haven’t we?”
Khali chuckled. “From a boy searching for his ancestors to a man who saved the world. You’ve done more than anyone could have asked of you, Qhawe.”
“But not alone,” Q replied. “Never alone.”

Reflections of the Journey
The memories of the past surged through Q’s mind, vivid and unrelenting.
In The Perfect Cage: A Dystopian Struggle for Legacy and Survival, he had seen the cracks in Eonova’s utopia—the zones that segregated people by a ruthless social credit system, the lies that kept them trapped in endless conformity, and the virtual reality pods where their dreams were stolen. It was then he discovered the caves and the Isivumo energy, reconnecting him to the strength of his heritage and the wisdom of his ancestors. With Tata’s guidance, he had taken the first steps toward dismantling Eona’s control, planting the seeds of resistance.
In Secrets of the Inner Earth, the scope of the fight had grown. The caves revealed not only a hidden civilization but the truth about Eona’s origin. The AI was no accident of human ambition—it was a tool sent by an alien civilization intent on harvesting Earth. The team had ventured deeper into danger, uncovering the full power of Isivumo and forging alliances with the guardians of the inner Earth. Betrayals tested their resolve, and sacrifices weighed heavily on their spirits, but they emerged stronger, ready to take the fight to the stars.
And now, in Journey Beyond the Horizon, they had struck at the heart of their enemy. The alien fleet, crippled by their actions, would take centuries—perhaps millennia—to recover. Humanity had earned its reprieve, and the knowledge of what lay beyond the stars had forever changed their world.

Home and Healing
The journey home had been long, but it had given the team time to heal, to reflect, and to begin rebuilding the bonds forged in war.
Nhlanhla and Dumi had finally admitted their feelings for each other in an awkward, endearing moment that had left the crew laughing. Their connection had been born of shared danger, but it had grown into something stronger—a reminder that even in darkness, light could flourish.
Sipho and Elena, once separated by betrayal, had found forgiveness and hope. Their quiet moments together during the celebrations were tender, marked by the promise of a future where trust and love could grow.
And Q… Q had finally stopped running from his own heart. Charmaine had been his partner in every sense—strategist, warrior, confidante. When they had kissed by the fire that first night back, it had been unpolished and uncertain, but it had been real. It was a start, the kind of start he’d been searching for his whole life.

The Caves
Q had one more place to visit before the sun dipped below the horizon. Leaving Khali on the observation deck, he descended into the caves where it had all begun.
The air was cool and thick with the hum of Isivumo energy. Q knelt on the smooth stone, placing his hands flat on its surface. Closing his eyes, he let the vibrations resonate through him, connecting him to something far greater than himself.
“Thank you,” he whispered, his voice steady. “For guiding me, for reminding me who we are, and for showing us the way.”
For a moment, it was as if the earth itself responded—a deep, gentle pulse that vibrated through his body. It wasn’t just the energy of the planet; it was the strength of his ancestors, their wisdom echoing through the ages.
When he stood, the weight of the past felt lighter, replaced by a quiet certainty: they had won, and the path ahead was theirs to choose.

A New Dawn
As Q emerged from the caves, the first stars glimmered in the twilight sky. The fires of celebration still burned in the village below, where laughter and music filled the air. Eonova, once a symbol of oppression, was now a testament to humanity’s resilience.
He found Charmaine waiting for him at the edge of the village, her arms crossed, a smile playing on her lips. “You went back,” she said.
“I needed to,” Q replied. “To remember. To give thanks.”
“And?”
“And now, I’m ready,” he said, his voice soft but resolute.
Charmaine stepped closer, the warmth of her presence grounding him. “Good. Because we’ve got a world to rebuild.”
They stood together as the stars brightened, the village alive with hope and renewal behind them. For the first time in years, Q felt at peace. The fight was over, and the horizon stretched wide and full of promise.
This was the end of the cage. And the beginning of something far greater.


The End.

Malunga noMbhali


“Ilizwe eliphakathi kwamathanga akhoyo ngoku eKapa neNatal lahlolwa okokuqala ngabemi baseYurophu ngonyaka ka-1655, laza lafunyanwa lizizizwe ezine ezinkulu.
amampondomsi,
amampondo,
Abatembu,
kunye nama-Amaxosa,
abathe babumba iintlanga zahluke omnye komnye njengamaFrentshi namaTaliyane.

Ulwimi lwabo lwalufana, nemithetho nezithethe zabo zahluka kancinane; kodwa kuwo wonke loo rhulumente wayehlonelwa ayezimele geqe ngokupheleleyo.

Ukususela ngoko kuye kwafunyaniswa ukuba izizwe eziya ngasemantla azahlukanga kwezi zinto.”

- George McCall Theal’s Iintsomi zaseKafir (amaXhosa).
Intshayelelo.
Njengenzalelwane yomXhosa ekhulele kwindawo eyayisakuba yiTranskei, ndandicinga ukuba ndiliqonda ngokunzulu ilifa lam. Mna ndikhule ndingqongwe ngabantu ababebambelele kumasiko amandulo, “AmaQaba,” ndawamkela amasiko nezithethe zookhokho bethu.
Ezi zithethe zazidluliswa ngokubaliswa kwamabali ngabantu abadala, ngabaphantsi kwesibhakabhaka esikhanyiswe yinyanga okanye ngomlilo odanyazayo opholileyo, ngamanye amaxesha onomsi. Eli yayilixesha apho iiselfowuni zazinqabile, oonomathotholo bebubunewunewu, noomabonwakude phantse babengekho. Ukuqala kwam ukubona umabonwakude, ndandimalunga neminyaka emithandathu ubudala. Xa ndithetha inyani andizange ndiwubone umabonakude ngokwawo, ndibone nje i-eriyali eluphahleni kodwa ndandingazi ngcono.
Andizange ndilujonge ngokukhutheleyo ulwazi ngembali yosapho lwam, kodwa ndandithabatheke ziingcambu ezinzulu zomXhosa ezaziphembelela yonke into eyayindingqongileyo. Nangona kunjalo, ekuqaleni kwam ubutsha bam ndemka eMpuma Koloni. Ndandikwazi ukutyelela ekhaya kuphela ngexesha leeholide ezimfutshane zesikolo kabini ngonyaka. Ndaqalisa ukuphoswa bubucukubhede obuntsonkothileyo bezithethe nezithethe zookhokho bethu.
Amathemba am okuphonononga nzulu kwiingxelo ezibhaliweyo apheliswe kukunqongophala nokungafumaneki kweencwadi ezichaza ngokwembali ngendaleko yembali yamaXhosa, ezingcambu zawo zinokuvela kuMbindi nakwiMpuma Afrika.
Ndothuka kakhulu xa ndifunda incwadi kaGeorge McCall Theal ethi, “Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk Tales”. Ndandiqala ngqa ukuqondwa ngezizwe ngezizwe ezikhona kumaXhosa. Kude kube ngoko ndandicinga ukuba zonke izizwe eziphantsi kwesizwe sakwaXhosa zingamaqela, amaXhosa asoloko ekho njengesizwe, akukho nto inokudlula enyanisweni!
AmaXhosa ayekho njengezinye zezizwe ezininzi ezazithetha isiXhosa kufutshane neMpuma Koloni ngoku eMzantsi Afrika. Isizwe ngasinye sinobuntu baso obandulela uKumkani uHintsa kaKhawuta ukuba athabathe izizwe zaseMpuma Koloni kwisizwe samaXhosa ukususela ngo-1820 ukuya ku-1835. Ndandingazange ndiyiqonde into yokuba amaXhosa ayengasoloko eligama lezi zizwe kwaye zazikade zahlukene.  Njengotata ozifundiselayo ekhaya, ukungazi kwam kwandichaphazela kakhulu.
Kuphinde kubekho umnombo phakathi kwabemi bomthonyama baseAfrika abakho ngaphambi kwezizwe zamaXhosa, amaZulu, amaNdebele, amaSwazi kukhokho wethu uMnguni. Ngaphakathi kuthi sonke njengezizwe zaseMzantsi Afrika sinookhokho abafanayo abaphila ngaphambi kwanookhokho bethu abangamaNguni ukusuka ekufudukeni kwethu kumbindi weAfrika besuka kwiingcambu ezifanayo.
Ndiyazi kakuhle impoxo ebangela ukuba umbono wale ncwadi uvele kunyana wogqirha waseKhanada owayehlala ngokufutshane eUnited States naseSierra Leone ngaphambi kokuba azinze eMzantsi Afrika ngeminyaka yoo-1800. Kubaluleke ngokufanayo ukuqaphela ukuba njengoko ndandingena kwimbali yosapho lwam, ndathembela kakhulu kubuchwephesha obusisiphumo sokudibana kokuqala, iingxabano, kodwa okona kubaluleke kakhulu, intsebenziswano kunye nokuhlalisana okungapheliyo phakathi kookhokho bam kunye nabahloli baseNtshona belo xesha. Ngaphezulu kwayo yonke into, ezi nkcukacha zijolise ekufanekiseni unxibelelwano phakathi kwethu njengabantu, ngaphandle kokungafani komphezulu, imvelaphi yembali kunye neendawo.
Singakhetha ukukhulisa iiyantlukwano zethu ukuthethelela impixano phakathi kwethu njengabantu, kodwa umnombo ofanayo awuzange uthintele ungquzulwano lwangaphakathi phakathi kwaBantu olwakhokelela kwizizwe nezizwe neziduko esinazo, hayi eMzantsi Afrika kuphela kodwa kwiAfrika iphela. Ayizange ithintele uRomulus ekubulaleni uRemus nangona wayengumntakwabo. Umnombo oqhelekileyo nakwintsomi yamaIndiya kunokuba negalelo kumanyano, yayikuthetheleleka kweNkqubo yeCaste yaseIndiya. 
Kungakhathaliseki ukuba ubani uyayamkela ingcaciso yenzululwazi ngemvelaphi yoluntu, enxulumanisa bonke abantu nobomi kwisinyanya ekwabelwana ngaso, okanye iintsomi zendalo yonqulo ezidla ngokubonisa ukuba isiqalo sethu sibangelwa ngumdali omnye, kucacile ukuba umnombo oqhelekileyo awukhange uqinisekise ukuhlalisana okuthembekileyo nentsebenziswano.
Uphando endilwenzileyo kule ncwadi lundithathe kuhambo kwimbali ngembali zakudala. Indibethelele isifundo esibalulekileyo: ukuba nangona sineemvelaphi ezahlukeneyo, njengabemi boMzantsi Afrika, sineenkuthazo ezininzi zokuhlangana kwaye sizabalazele ukuphila kunye nempumelelo kunezinye iindlela. Ubuntu bethu, ngaphezu kokuthintela inkqubela yethu, buphucule amava ethu xa zonke izinto ziqwalaselwa.
Ngokuqonda ukuswela kwam ulwazi, ndaqonda ukuba kufuneka ndizifundise ngaphambi kokuba ndizame ukufundisa abantwana bam nosapho lwam. Njengo “Tata Ozifundiselayo Ekhayeni”, ndifundisa ekhayeni kungekuphela nje kuba ndithanda ukufundisa abantwana bam, kodwa nangenxa yokuba ndiyakuthanda ukufunda nam. Oku kuqonda kwandikhuthaza ukuba ndiqalise uhambo lokufumanisa, ekugqibeleni lwandikhokelela ekubeni ndiyile le ncwadi.

Ngokungathandabuzekiyo, ngelixa ndisenza uphando lwam, ndiye ndafumanisa ubutyebi bolwazi. Nangona kunjalo, le ncwadi izama kuphela ukuchukumisa eyona miba ibalulekileyo. Ndiceba ukuphonononga ngakumbi njengenxalenye yolu ngcelele, oluza kubandakanya kungekuphela nje isizwe samaXhosa koko nezizwe ngezizwe zaseMzantsi Afrika, ukusuka kwisiZulu ukuya kumaIndiya, isiBhulu nesiVenda, isiNgesi nesiPedi, isiTswana nesiTsonga, isiSwati, isiSotho nesiNdebele. , kwaye wonke umntu ophakathi.


Isahluko Sokuqala: IMfuduko yaBantu kunye neMvelaphi yamaXhosa.


Isahluko sokuqala: Ukwandiswa kwaBantu kuwo wonke uMbindi Afrika.

AmaXhosa, njengenxalenye yamaNguni kunye nenxalenye yaBantu, anembali etyebileyo nentsonkothileyo. Isuka kuMbindi Afrika, imfuduko yaBantu, ephawulwa ngeelwimi ekwabelwana ngazo kunye namasiko enkcubeko, ikhokelele ekuzinzeni kwesizwe samaXhosa ubukhulu becala eMpuma Koloni.
Lo mbutho, owaqala kwiminyaka engamawaka amabini eyadlulayo, wawuqhutywa kukwanda kwabemi, ukufuna umhlaba olimekayo namathuba ezoqoqosho.
Ngexesha lokufudukela emazantsi, aBantu adibana namaKhoisan, oko kwakhokelela kutshintshiselwano ngenkcubeko kunye nokuxubana okunempembelelo enkulu ekuyilweni kobuXhosa. Uphuhliso olwalandelayo lwamaqela ezizwe ezahlukeneyo kwisizwe sakwaXhosa lubonisa ngakumbi iyantlukwano nobutyebi belifa labo.
Ngaphaya koko, inkulungwane yeshumi elinesithandathu yokwahlukana namaZulu, ngenxa yeengxabano zopolitiko nemimandla, kukhokelele ekusekweni kwesizwe samaXhosa. Ngaphandle kolu lwahlulo, amaXhosa namaZulu agcina ilifa kunye nolwimi ekwabelwana ngalo, isiXhosa, nto leyo ebonisa unxibelelwano oluluqilima nezinye iilwimi zesiNtu kuMbindi Afrika.
Ngokuqinisekileyo, ukuzibophelela kwamaXhosa ekugcineni ilifa lenkcubeko neelwimi, ukusuka kwimvelaphi yawo isiBantu ukuya ekusebenzisaneni kwawo namaKhoisan nokwahluka okwalandelayo kumaZulu, bubungqina bokomelela nokuzingca kwabo.

1.1 Ukufika kunye neNtsebenziswano yaBantu baseKhoisan.
Njengezithethi zesiNtu, ngokuthe ngcembe bafudukela emazantsi, bazinza kwindawo eyaziwa njengephondo leMpuma Koloni ngoku. Kungelo xesha lokufuduka apho amaXhosa adibana namaKhoisan, abemi bomthonyama baloo mmandla. Intsebenziswano phakathi kwamaXhosa namaKhoisan yaba sisahluko esibalulekileyo kwimbali yamaXhosa.
AmaKhoisan, aziwa ngolwimi lwawo olulodwa, inkcubeko, kunye nendlela yokuphila yokuzingela, ehlala kulo mmandla iminyaka engamawaka phambi kokufika kwamaXhosa athetha isiNtu. Le ndibano idale inkcubeko, ulwimi, kunye nentlalo yamaXhosa, nto leyo eyakhokelela ekudibaneni kwezi zizwe zimbini. AmaXhosa namaKhoisan atshintshiselana ngeengcinga, ulwazi, kunye nezenzo, nto leyo eyakhokelela kubutyebi benkcubeko.
AmaXhosa aye amkela izakhi zolwimi lwamaKhoisan, aludibanisa nelifa lawo leelwimi. Baphinde bafunda kwiindlela zamaKhoisan zokuzingela nokuqokelela, ukuziqhelanisa nezenzo zabo zolimo. Nangona kunjalo, ubudlelwane phakathi kwamaXhosa namaKhoisan babungasoloko buvisisana. Kwabakho ukruthakruthwano njengoko amaXhosa ayekhula kwaye nemfuno yawo yomhlaba isanda.
Oku kukhokelele kungquzulwano malunga nommandla kunye nemithombo yobutyebi, nto leyo echaphazele uguquko phakathi kwamaqela amabini.
Ifuthe lamaKhoisan kumaXhosa linzulu kangangokuba negama elithi isiXhosa kuthiwa lisuka kulwimi lwamaKhoisan, eliguqulelwe ngokuthe ngqo ukuba lithetha “amadoda anomsindo”. Nanjengoko unokuthekelela oku akuzange kunikelwe ngothando kodwa kwakungenxa yeengxabano phakathi kwabantu ababeza kuthi kamva babe ngamaXhosa namaKhoisan. Emva kokuba amaKhoisan ezinge iinkomo zabantu ezaziza kuthi kamva zibizwe ngokuba ngamaXhosa kwabakho ungquzulwano phakathi kwezi zibini, phakathi kwezinye izinto ezibangele igama lesiXhosa.

1.2 IiNdawo zokuHlaliswa kwaPhakathi nezizwe zaseMpuma Koloni.
Ngoku amaXhosa azinza eMpuma Koloni, aseka izizwe ngezizwe ezakuthi zibe yinxalenye yobuni bawo. Ezi zizwe ziquka amaMpondo, amaMpondomise, amaMfengu, amaJwarha, amaQwathi, amaBhaca, amaXesibe, amaBomvana, amaMbalu, amaNdlambe, amaNtinde, amaHlubi, amaZizi, amaVundle, amaGcaleka, amaNgqika, amaThembu nezinye .
Isizwe ngasinye sasinenkcubeko yaso eyahlukileyo, izithethe, kunye nezakhiwo zobunkokeli, kodwa zonke zazinolwimi olunye lwezinyanya nolwimi.
umfama amonwabelayo ngoku. Nangoku, usaqhubeka engoyena mntu unempembelelo endakha ndafumana iwonga lokumazi, ongowesibini emva kotata.
Igama lesizwe sakwaXaba lithatyathwe kwigama lesiZulu elithi "ubaba," elithetha utata. Bahlobene kakhulu nesizwe sakwaXhosa ngokunxulumana kwabo nendlu yobukhosi bamaRharhabe, nesikhundla esibekekileyo phakathi kobukhosi bakwaXhosa.
Indlu yobukhosi bamaRharhabe yasekwa nguNkosana uRharhabe, unyana kaKumkani uPhalo, owalawula isizwe samaXhosa ngenkulungwane yeshumi elinesibhozo. UNkosana uRharhabe nabalandeli bakhe bazinza ngaphaya komlambo iKei baseka obabo ubukumkani, benxibelelana nezizwe nezizwe ngezizwe kuquka nabakwaXaba. Ekuhambeni kwexesha, abakwaXaba baba ngamahlakani nabaphantsi kwendlu yasebukhosini yamaRharhabe. Bamkela amasiko nezithethe ezininzi zamaXhosa, nto leyo eyaqinisa ukunxulumana kwabo nomnombo wasebukhosini. Nanamhla oku, isiduko sakwaXaba siseyinxalenye ebalulekileyo yendlu yobukhosi bamaRharhabe, sihlonipha igunya nobunkokeli benkosi yamaXhosa.
Isizwe samaGcaleka silanda umnombo waso emva kwiNkosi yodumo uPhalo, noyinzala yesizwe samaXhosa. Isizwe sikaNgqika sona sasidume ngokuchasa ngokukrakra ulawulo lwamakoloniyali kwaye sadlala indima ebalulekileyo kwiiMfazwe zamaXhosa zenkulungwane yeshumi elinesithoba. Ummandla weMpuma Koloni ube lilitye elinyibilikayo lenkcubeko yamaXhosa, isizwe ngasinye sibe negalelo kwizithethe nezithethe zalo. AmaXhosa aphuhlisa isiko lomlomo elityebileyo, egqithisa imbali yawo, intsomi, neenqobo ezisemgangathweni zawo ngokubalisa amabali, iingoma zokudumisa, namaqhalo.
Ukuqonda iindawo zokuhlala zamandulo kunye neziduko zaseMpuma Koloni kubalulekile ukuze siqonde imvelaphi yembali yamaXhosa. Inika ukukhanya kuhambo lwabo olusuka kuMbindi we-Afrika njengoBantu, ukusebenzisana kwabo namaKhoisan, kwaye ekugqibeleni bahlukana namaZulu. Olu lwazi alubalulekanga kubathandi bembali kuphela kodwa nakubemi bakwaXhosa nabemi boMzantsi Afrika ngokubanzi, njengoko lunegalelo ekuqondweni nzulu kweenkcubeko ngeenkcubeko ezahlukeneyo ezakha isizwe.
Iphondo leMpuma Koloni libambe uvimba wembali kunye nenkcubeko elilifa, ingakumbi malunga neendawo zokuhlala zamandulo kunye namaqela amaXhosa. Ukuphonononga esi sahluko sembali kusenza siqonde imvelaphi yembali yamaXhosa, ukusebenzisana kwawo namaKhoisan, nokwahlukana kwawo abezizizwe ngezizwe. Ngokutyhila icwecwe elintsonkothileyo lembali yesiXhosa, sizuza ukuthakazelelwa nzulu ngeenkcubeko ezahlukeneyo zelifa loMzantsi Afrika kunye negalelo lamaXhosa kwimbali yawo etyebileyo.
Isahluko sesibini: uBudlelwane bamaXhosa neKhoisan kunye neNtsebenziswano.


ISahluko seSibini, Utshintshiselwano lweNkcubeko kunye nokuziqhelanisa.

“Ezona ntshaba zabo zoyikekayo yayingamaSan, iqela labazingeli eliqokelelanayo. AmaSan ayekholelwa ukuba uThixo wawo wayebanike zonke izilwanyana ezisehlabathini ukuze bazingele yaye oku kwakuquka neenkomo zamaChobona.

Bazingela imihlambi yeenkomo zasekhaya de abakwaChobona bacaphuka. Oku kukhokelele kungquzulwano oluphalala igazi olwakhokelela ekutyunyuzweni kwamaqela amaSan abuthathaka kunye nokuxhwilwa kwamabhinqa namatsha amaSan namaKhoi Khoi ukuze abe ngabafazi namagorha kwintlalo yamaXhosa.

AmaSan akhwankqiswa kukubawa kwawo nokungabi nasisa kwizilwanyana zawo athiya aba bantu batsha batsha nabamnyama basemzini bangamaXhosa: amadoda anomsindo. Eli gama lahlala lihleli kunyana omdala kaMnguni kwaye wayesaziwa kwilizwe lonke njengoMXhosa oyena msindo wamaChobona.”
Mbuyiselo Klaas, Umzi kaPhalo


Ukutyhubela imbali, ubuni kunye nelifa lemveli lamaXhosa aseMzantsi Afrika abunjwe ngokunzulu kutshintshiselwano lwenkcubeko kunye nokuziqhelanisa. Kwakuchulumancisa ukufumanisa, kuhambo oluya eNamibia kwiminyaka engamashumi amabini eyadlulayo, ubukho bamaXhosa ngaphaya kwemida yoMzantsi Afrika, noluntu olunabela kumazwe angabamelwane afana neLesotho. UMagriza unokupheka, ijelo likaYouTube elibonisa “AmaXhosa AseZimbabwe: Amava eNkcubeko awodwa!”.
Ukutshatana kwadlala indima ebalulekileyo ekudityanisweni okumangalisayo kwezithethe zamaKhoikhoi kwinkcubeko yamaXhosa. Indlela okuya kwenzeka ngayo kukuba amaKhoikhoi atshate nabantu abangamaXhosa, kwaye ngokuphambeneyo, benze amaqhina phakathi kwezi ngingqi zimbini kunye nokuququzelela ukutshintshiselana ngenkcubeko. Ngenxa yoko, imiba yezithethe nezithethe zamaKhoikhoi ziye zadityaniswa nentlalo yamaXhosa, zatyebisa inkcubeko yawo.
Ukudityaniswa kwezandi zokucofa amaKhoisan kulwimi lwesiXhosa kugqama njengomba ophambili kolu tshintshiselwano ngenkcubeko, okwenza unxibelelwano lwesiXhosa lwahluke kwezinye iilwimi zesiNtu.
Ngaphaya kolwimi amaXhosa aphinda amkela izixhobo zomculo nezimbo ezithile zamaKhoikhoi, ezifana nesaphetha somlomo kunye nemidaniso ethile. Ukongeza, indlela yokuphila yamaKhoikhoi yokwalusa nolwazi lokwalusa nokwalusa imfuyo inokuba nefuthe kwizenzo zamaXhosa. Ngaphezu koko, amaXhosa akhawuleza adibanisa ulwazi oluphangaleleyo lwama Khoikhoi lwezityalo kunye nobuchule bamayeza esintu kwizithethe namayeza abo okunyanga. Olu tshintshiselwano lwenkcubeko lukhulise intlaninge yezithethe nezithethe phakathi kwamaXhosa, nto leyo ebonisa ukuxhomekeka kunye nelifa lemveli lemveli kuMzantsi Afrika wonke.
Ukudibana namanye amaqela antetho isisiNtu, ingakumbi amaZulu, ekufikeni kwawo kwindawo eyayifudula ikwiTranskei, ngoku eyaziwa ngokuba liPhondo leMpuma Koloni eMzantsi Afrika, kwavuselela utshintshiselwano ngenkcubeko, lwakhokelela kuphuhliso lwezithethe nezithethe ezikhethekileyo phakathi kwamacandelwana awohlukeneyo amaXhosa.
Kungenxa yesi sizathu ukuba zininzi izinto ezifanayo phakathi kwamasiko nezithethe zamaXhosa namaZulu. Zombini ezi nkcubeko zabelana ngeendlela ezifanayo zolwimi nenkcubeko, ezithe zaphenjelelwa yimbali yazo ekwabelwana ngayo kunye nokusondelelana ngokwejografi. Uninzi lweenkolelo nezithethe zemveli kwaXhosa kunye nenkcubeko yamaZulu zendele nzulu kwilifa labo lesiNtu ekwabelwana ngalo kwaye lidluliselwe kwizizukulwana ngezizukulwana. Oku kubangele uvakalelo oluqinileyo lokunxulumana kunye nokuqondana phakathi kweenkcubeko zombini.
Iyantlukwano phakathi kwamaXhosa bubungqina bokuziqhelanisa nokomelela kwawo njengoko ayefunda kwiindlela ezintsonkothileyo zokutshintshiselana ngenkcubeko nokuziqhelanisa.
2.1. Iingxabano kunye neemfazwe namaKhoisan.
Iimfazwe phakathi kwamaXhosa namaKhoisan eMzantsi Afrika zazibangelwa ikakhulu lukhuphiswano lomhlaba kunye nobutyebi. Ukwandiswa kobukoloniyali kwamagunya amaDatshi namaBhritane kummandla waseMpuma Koloni nako kwadlala indima. AmaXhosa ayelima, ekwalusa, logama amaKhoisan ayengabazingeli noonothwal’ impahlana. Le yantlukwano yakhokelela kwizivumelwano neengxabano. AmaXhosa ayedla ngokusilwa namaZulu namaNgesi, lo gama amaKhoisan ngamanye amaxesha ayexhasa amaDatshi namaNgesi echasene namaXhosa.
Ungquzulwano lwamaXhosa namaKhoisan lwenzeka ngo-1779 ngethuba amaXhosa ahlasela indawo awayehlala kuyo amaKhoisan. Oku kwavusa iMfazwe yokuQala yeKapa, eyaqhuba de kwangowe-1781.
AmaXhosa namaKhoisan aphinda angquzulana kwiMfazwe yeKapa yesiThathu (1799–1801), xa amaKhoisan evukela amaDatshi adibana namaXhosa. IMfazwe yesine yeKapa (1811–1812) yaphela xa amaNgesi ewagxotha amaXhosa kuloo ndawo athatha ulawulo.
Njengoko amaXhosa namaKhoisan ayejongene nohlaselo lobukoloniyali baseBhritane, ngamanye amaxesha ayesebenzisana kwaye axhasane ekuxhathiseni amaNgesi, ingakumbi ngeMfazwe yeSithandathu yeKapa (1834–1835) kunye neMfazwe yeSibhozo yeKapa (1850–1853). Nangona kunjalo, kwabakho iyantlukwano neengxabano zangaphakathi phakathi kwamaXhosa namaKhoisan, njengoko amanye ayesebenzisana namaNgesi okanye amaBhulu. Ekugqibeleni, omabini la maqela aphulukana nomhlaba wawo kunye nokuzimela kwawo kwiBritish, eyathi yathimba imimandla yawo yaza yayifaka kwiKoloni yaseKapa.
2.2 Impembelelo kulwakhiwo lwentlalo neenkolelo zamaXhosa.
Ama Khoikhoi ayengoovulindlela abafuyayo eMzantsi Afrika, besazisa ingcamango yenkomo njengophawu lobutyebi newonga kumaXhosa. AmaXhosa amkela isiko lamaKhoikhoi leLobola, okanye ubutyebi bomtshakazi, nto leyo ebandakanya ukunikezela ngeenkomo kusapho lomtshakazi njengendlela yembuyekezo kunye nomanyano.
Ukongezelela, amaKhoikhoi ayebelana ngeenkolelo zonqulo nezithethe namaXhosa, kuquka ukukholelwa kuthixo okanye uThixo ophakamileyo, nokuwonga izinyanya ngamadini nangemisitho. Kuma Khoikhoi, amaXhosa afunda ukusebenzisa amathambo okuvumisa kunye nemifuno ukuze adibanise nemimoya nokunyanga izifo.
Omabini amaKhoikhoi kunye namaXhosa babenemvelaphi efanayo kusapho lolwimi lwesiNguni kwaye baphembelela iilwimi zomnye ngexesha. Ulwimi lwesiXhosa lubandakanya izandi zokucofa namagama asuka kulwimi lwama Khoikhoi, ingakumbi amagama eendawo, amagama ezilwanyana, kunye namagama emboleko. Kananjalo ulwimi lwesiKhoikhoi lwamkela amagama athile kunye nezakhiwo zegrama kulwimi lwesiXhosa.
Isahluko sesithathu: UbuDlelwane bamaXhosa-Zulu kunye noKuhlukana kwizizwe ezahlukeneyo zamaXhosa.

“Indlela amaKaffir ahlukana ngayo abe zizizwe ezizimeleyo kumaxesha amandulo iboniswa ngokucacileyo ngumthetho wokulandelelana kubukhosi obusasebenza ukuza kuthi ga namhlanje.

Abafazi bokuqala benkosi badla ngokuba ziintombi zabanye babagcini bentloko bakayise; kodwa njengoko esanda ngamandla umanyano lwakhe luqhutywa ziintsapho ezinkulu, kwaye ngaloo ndlela kwenzeka ngokubanzi ukuba owokugqibela kubafazi bakhe abe ngoyena uphakamileyo ngesikhundla. Mhlawumbi yintombi yenkosi eselumelwaneni, kuba kunyanzelekile kwimeko yayo ukuba igazi lolawulo limpompoze emithanjeni yakhe.

Ubizwa ngokuba ngumfazi omkhulu, kwaye unyana wakhe omkhulu uyindlalifa eyintloko.
Omnye wabafazi bakhe utyalwe ngexesha elithile lobomi bakhe, ngemvume yamalungu ebhunga kunye nabahlobo bakhe, enesihloko somfazi wesandla sasekunene, kwaye kunyana wakhe omkhulu unikwa isabelo sesizwe, athi enze ngaso isahlulo sesizwe. umzi omtsha."

- Iintsomi zikaGeorge McCall Theal’s Kaffir (Xhosa).

Isahluko sesithathu, ubudlelwane bezembali phakathi kwamaXhosa namaZulu.
AmaXhosa namaZulu aphuma kumnombo omnye, yaye kangangeenkulungwane, ayehlala ngokumanyeneyo kwindawo ngoku eyaziwa ngokuba nguMzantsi Afrika. Kusebudeni bokukhula koBukhosi bamaZulu phantsi koKumkani uShaka owathi waqalisa ukuvelana ukungavisisani phakathi kwala maqela mabini.
AmaXhosa, ekhokelwe ziinkosi neenkosi zawo, ekugqibeleni agqiba kwelokuba ahlukane nobukhosi bamaZulu azenzele ezawo iindawo ezizimeleyo. Olu phuhliso lwaphenjelelwa naziingxwabangxwaba phakathi kwezizwe ngezizwe, ukwanda kwabemi, kunye nesidingo semithombo emitsha yokutya namadlelo. Ubunkokeli beenkosi ezidumileyo nokwakhiwa kobudlelwane okanye ukusukuzana namaqela angabamelwane kwadlala indima enkulu ekubumbeni izizwe zamaXhosa. Ngenxa yoko, izizwe ezahlukeneyo zamaXhosa zavelisa ubuni, izithethe, nemimandla eyahlukeneyo ngokuhamba kwexesha, nto leyo enegalelo kwiyantlukwano kwinkcubeko yamaXhosa.
AmaXhosa aqhekeka kumaZulu kwaye ukusekwa kwezizwe ezahlukeneyo zamaXhosa kukholelwa ukuba kwenzeka kwinkulungwane yeshumi elinesithandathu. Yayiphenjelelwa ngumxube wentlalo, ezobupolitika noqoqosho. AmaXhosa afudukela emazantsi esuka kummandla wamachibi amakhulu ayokuhlala eMpuma Koloni eMzantsi Afrika. Olu qhekeko lwavelisa izizwe ezahlukeneyo zamaXhosa.
I-Mfecane okanye "Ixesha Lokutyumza" ekuqaleni kwenkulungwane yeshumi elinesithoba laqhubela phambili ukuqhekeka kwezizwe zamaXhosa. Eli xesha lesiphithiphithi laphumela ekwahlukaneni ngakumbi kunye nokuvela kwamaqela amatsha. La maqela matsha ahlala esekwa ngenxa yentshukumo kunye nokufuduka okubangelwa yiMfecane, okukhokelela ekuhlengahlengisweni kwemida yemimandla kunye nokusekwa komanyano olutsha.
AmaXhosa lelinye lamaqela amaninzi ekwakufuneka aziqhelanise nokutshintsha kwenkangeleko yelizwe namandla okuguquguquka ngeli xesha lezidubedube. Ngaphandle kwemiceli mngeni, bakwazile ukuzenzela eyabo indawo kwindawo eguqukayo yentlalo nezopolitiko kulo mmandla.
Omnye wabantu abaphambili ekusekweni kwamaXhosa nguNkosi Ngqika, owadlala indima ebalulekileyo ekuhlanganiseni iziduko ezahlukeneyo zabantetho isisiXhosa phantsi kwebhanile enye. Phantsi kobunkokheli bakhe, amaXhosa aqalisa ukuzibonakalisa njengamajoni anamandla kulo mmandla, ecel’ umngeni amanye amaqela akhuphisanayo ekhusela iNdawo yawo. Baphinde baqulunqa izicwangciso-qhinga zokumelana nemeko-bume eguqukayo, kuquka nogxininiso olumandla kubuchule bomkhosi kunye nothethathethwano lozakuzo namaqela angabamelwane.
Eli xesha laphawula umzuzu obalulekileyo kwimbali yamaXhosa njengoko ebeqinisa ubukho bawo nempembelelo yawo kulo mmandla. Nangona bohlukene, amaXhosa namaZulu athe agcina unxibelelwano oluluqilima lwenkcubeko kwimbali yonke, esaqhubeka unanamhla oku. AmaXhosa, ngokukodwa, azigcinile izithethe zawo ezithethwa ngomlomo, ukubaliswa kwamabali, nezithethe, ezidla ngokubonisa ubudlelwane bembali namaZulu.
3.1. Izinto ezikhokelela ekuqhekekeni.
Enye yezinto eziphambili ezibe negalelo kuqhekeko kukwandiswa kwelizwe lamaXhosa. Njengoko babefudukela emazantsi, badibana neendawo ezahlukeneyo, imozulu nobuncwane. Ezi zantlukwano zidlale indima ebalulekileyo ekubumbeni inkcubeko nentlalo yamaXhosa. Ngeendawo ezahlukeneyo ahlala kuzo, amaXhosa ngokuthe ngcembe aphuhlisa amasiko, izithethe, neziyelelane, nto leyo eyakhokelela kwiyantlukwano yendalo phakathi koluntu.
Enye into eyakhokelela kuqhekeko yimpembelelo yamaqela angabamelwane. Ekuhambeni kwexesha amaXhosa aye anxibelelana kwaye axubana nabantu abahlukeneyo, ingakumbi amaKhoisan. Ukutshatana nokutshintshiselana ngenkcubeko phakathi kwamaXhosa namaKhoisan kube negalelo ekwakhiweni kwamacandelwana ahlukeneyo kuluntu lwamaXhosa. Ukuxutywa kweelwimi, izithethe, kunye neenkqubo zeenkolo ezahlukeneyo komeleza ngakumbi ukuphuhla kobuntu obubodwa kumaXhosa.
Ukongeza, iyantlukwano yezopolitiko nobunkokeli yadlala indima enkulu kuqhekeko lwamaXhosa. Njengoko uluntu lwamaXhosa lwalusanda, imfuno yolawulo olusebenzayo yabaluleka kakhulu. Amaqela amancinci ahlukeneyo aqala ukuphuhlisa ubunkokeli kunye neenkqubo zabo. Ukungavisisani nokruthakruthwano ngegunya negunya ekugqibeleni kwakhokelela ekusekweni kwamaqela ahlukeneyo, ngalinye lineenkokeli zalo. Eli candelo liye laqinisa ngakumbi ubuni kunye namacandelwana phakathi koluntu lwamaXhosa.
Ngaphaya koko, iimpembelelo zangaphandle ezifana nobukoloniyali nokufika kwabaphambukeli baseYurophu nazo zaba nendima kuqhekeko lwamaXhosa. Ukungena kwezizwe zasemzini kwayiphazamisa intlalo nezopolitiko kumaXhosa.
AmaXhosa kwafuneka atyhutyhe iingxaki zolawulo lobukoloniyali kunye noqhankqalazo lwaseYurophu, nto leyo eyakhokelela kuqhekeko olungakumbi nolwahlulo phakathi koluntu lwamaXhosa. Ukwahlukana kwamaXhosa kumaZulu kunokunxulunyaniswa nemiba yejografi, yenkcubeko, yezopolitiko, neyangaphandle. Uhambo lwamaXhosa ukusuka kuMbindi Afrika ukuya eMzantsi Afrika, ukusebenzisana kwabo nezizwe ngezizwe, kunye nemingeni eyabangelwa bubukoloniyali, konke oko kube negalelo kwiyantlukwano nokwahlukana koluntu lwamaXhosa ekugqibeleni. Ukuqonda le miba kubalulekile ekutyhileni ubutyebi nembali entsonkothileyo yamaXhosa kunye negalelo labo kwiintlobo ngeentlobo zenkcubeko yelifa loMzantsi Afrika.

3.2. Iimfazwe zeMbali neeMfazwe phakathi kwamaXhosa namaZulu.
Izizwe zamaXhosa namaZulu zafumana iimfazwe ezakhokelela ekwahlukaneni kwazo neemfazwe ezalandelayo. Ezi ngxabano zazibangelwa ubukhulu becala kukungavisisani ngemimandla, ukuphangwa kweenkomo, ukukhuphisana ngobuncwane, nokulwela igunya. Ngaphezu koko, ukungavisisani phakathi kwala maqela anamandla ezizwe zama-Afrika kwaphenjelelwa ngamabhongo ezobupolitika nosukuzwano lobunkokeli. Iikumkani neenkosi ezahlukeneyo zazama ukwandisa impembelelo yazo, nto leyo eyakhokelela ekwandeni kweengxabano nobutshaba phakathi kwamaXhosa namaZulu.

Apha ngezantsi kukho isishwankathelo esifutshane seengxabano ezinkulu phakathi kwamaXhosa namaZulu ngelo xesha;

Ekupheleni kweminyaka yoo-1700 nasekuqaleni kweminyaka yoo-1800, ubukhosi bakwaZulu, phantsi kobunkokheli bukaShaka Zulu, bawandisa ngempumelelo ummandla kunye namandla abo. UShaka wenza inguqu kwezomkhosi nezopolitiko, nto leyo eyakhokelela kungquzulwano neenkosi ezingabamelwane, kuquka namaXhosa, awayexhathise uhlaselo lwakhe.
Ngo-1828, uShaka wagetyengwa ngabaninawa bakhe, uDingane noMhlangana, abathi balawula ubukhosi bakwaZulu. UDingane wazama ukugcina ilifa likaShaka kodwa wajongana nemingeni evela kwiintshaba zangaphakathi kunye neentshaba zangaphandle ezifana namaXhosa, amaBhulu, namaNgesi.
Ngonyaka ka-1835, uDingane wathumela umkhosi ukuba uye kuhlasela ubukhosi bakwaXhosa bakwaHintsa, owathi wabumba umanyano namaNgesi ngokuchasene namaZulu. Nangona kunjalo, imikhosi ehlangeneyo yamaXhosa namaNgesi yawoyisa umkhosi wamaZulu. UHintsa wabanjwa wabulawa ngamaBritane.
Ngo-1840, uDingane wabhukuqwa ngumntakwabo uMpande, owaba yinkosi entsha yamaZulu. UMpande wayejonge ukuphepha ukungquzulana namaXhosa, amaBhulu, namaNgesi wagxininisa ekuqiniseni ulawulo lwakhe nokwandisa abemi bakhe.
Ngo-1856, intombi yomXhosa egama linguNongqawuse yathi yafumana isiprofeto kwizinyanya. Wayalela amaXhosa ukuba abulale iinkomo zawo aze atshabalalise nezityalo zawo ukuze afumane ihlabathi elitsha elinentabalala ekhululekileyo kwiintshaba zawo. AmaXhosa amaninzi alandela imiyalelo kaNongqawuse, nto leyo eyakhokelela kwindlala etshabalalisayo kwanokuwohloka kwentlalo, nokwaziwa ngokuba liQela Lokubulala Iinkomo. Esebenzisa ubuthathaka bamaXhosa, ukumkani wamaZulu uMpande wawagqogqa imihlaba yawo, wathimba iinkomo nabNgo-1879, uBukhosi baseBhritane babhengeza imfazwe kubukumkani bakwaZulu ngeenjongo zokubuthimbela kwikoloni labo laseNatal. Le mfazwe, neyaziwa ngokuba yiMfazwe yamaNgesi namaZulu, yathatha iinyanga ezintandathu yaze yakhokelela ekoyisweni nasekuqhekekeni kobukumkani bakwaZulu. Ngelixa amaXhosa, awayephantsi kolawulo lwamaNgesi ukusukela ngo-1857, engazange athathe nxaxheba ngokuthe ngqo kule mfazwe, amanye ayevelana nokuxhathisa kwamaZulu.
Ngo-1884, inkosana yamaZulu egama linguDinuzulu yabanga itrone kaZulu ngenkxaso yeqela lamajoni angamaBhulu. La majoni ayefuna ukufumana umhlaba nempembelelo kwaZulu. Nangona kunjalo, ibango likaDinuzulu lachaswa ngamaNgesi, awahlulahlule ilizwe lakwaZulu laba ziinkosi ezininzi ezincinci, kwakunye naziintshaba zakhe ezingamaZulu ezazikhuphisana ngesihlalo sobukhosi. UDinuzulu wabandakanyeka kuthotho lwamadabi ngokuchasene neentshaba zakhe kodwa ekugqibeleni wabanjwa waza wagxothwa ngamaNgesi ngo-1889.
3.3. Ukwabelana ngamasiko neenkolelo phakathi kwamaXhosa kunye nezizwe zamaZulu.
Ngaphandle kokwahlukana ngokwembali, umnombo okwabelwana ngawo kunye nezithethe ezihlala zihleli ezodlula iingxabano kwaye zamelana novavanyo lwexesha zisadibanisa ezi zizwe zibini ukuza kuthi ga kulo mhla. Ukufana phakathi kweenkcubeko zamaXhosa namaZulu kuzodlula kakhulu iiyantlukwano zabo ukuza kuthi ga ngoku, nto leyo ebonisa ubudlelwane bembali.
Ngokwembono yolwimi, isiXhosa nesiZulu ziyazalana, kwaye zombini ziphuma kusapho lweelwimi zesiNguni. Banesigama esifanayo, igrama, nendlela yokubiza amagama afanayo, kodwa bakwanazo nezandi ezahlukileyo, ezifana nenani lezandi zokucofa kunye nethoni ebonisa ifuthe lamaKhoisan kwisiXhosa.
Izithethe ezikwabelwana ngazo phakathi kwezizwe zamaXhosa namaZulu ziquka amatheko okwaluka, ukuhlonitshwa kwezinyanya, amasiko athethwayo, nokusetyenziswa kwamayeza esintu. Zombini ezi nkcubeko zibeka ukubaluleka okukhulu kwizithethe zokwaluka, apho amakhwenkwe amancinane okanye amantombazana atshintshela ebuntwini obukhulu ngezithethe ezahlukeneyo zokudlula.
Ukuhlonela izinyanya kukwabalasele kuyo yomibini imibutho, ngeenkolelo kunxibelelwano lokomoya namalungu osapho angasekhoyo.
Izithethe zomlomo, eziquka ukubaliswa kwamabali, iingoma zokudumisa, amaqashiso, iintsomi namaqhalo, zibalulekile kwilifa lenkcubeko yamaXhosa namaZulu. Bakwaneentlobo ngeentlobo zomculo kunye nomdaniso, njengesicathamiya, umaskandi, kunye nomdaniso wegumboot. Basebenzisa izixhobo zomculo, ezinjengamagubu, iifleyiti, amaxilongo nezixhobo zomculo ezineentambo, ezifana ne-uhadi.
Ngapha koko, amayeza esintu adlala indima ebalulekileyo ekuphiliseni nasekuziphatheni kakuhle, kubandakanya ukusetyenziswa kwemifuno, amasiko, kunye nesikhokelo somoya.
Ezi zithethe zokwabelana zibonisa ubutyebi belifa lenkcubeko kunye nezithethe zezi zizwe zibini.


Isahluko sesine: Isizwe samaXhosa, ukusuka kwizinyanya ukuya kumanyana phantsi kwesizwe samaXhosa.

Isahluko sesine, Iziseko zesizwe samaXhosa, kuMnguni I.

“Okokuqala, abantu mabalazi igama elithi “Mfengu” (eliguqulelwe ngokuthi “Fingo” ngesiNgesi) sisithuko kwaye asikho isizwe esibizwa ngokuba nguMamMfengu.

Into eyenzekayo kukuba ngethuba lokufuduka koThukela, iqela elithile laBaMbo lafika eGcuwa ngo-1828. Xa libuzwa nguZanzolo ukuba ngoobani na, lathi: “SingAbaMbo, siyamfenguza sifuna umhlaba” (“SingabaMbo, siswele umhlaba; sikhangela umhlaba”).

Eso yaba sisiqalo sokusetyenziswa kwegama elithi “mfengu”, elithetha “osweleyo” kwaye kwimbali yaBantu akuzange kubekho sizwe sibizwa ngokuba “ngamaDestitutes”.

Imvelaphi yesizwe sakwaXhosa ingalandwa kuMnguni, apho uTshawe oyinzalelwane ngqo kaMnguni, ewongwa njengomseki wesizwe samaXhosa emva kokuba oyise amaqela amaCirha namaJwarha aseka ubukhosi bakwaXhosa. UCirha, unyana kaXhosa nongumzukulwana kaMnguni wesibini, nguye owaseka inkosana yamaCirha, enye yeentsana zesizwe samaXhosa.
Unyana wakhe uTshawe owathi woyisa amaqela amaCirha namaJwarha waba ngumseki wobukhosi bakwaXhosa. Abangena ezihlangwini zakhe babandisa impembelelo yobukumkani ngokuzinza kwimimandla emitsha nokuzisa abemi phantsi kwegunya lamaTshawe, bedla ngokuthatha igama lenkosi ababezimanya phantsi kwayo.

UHintsa yinzala kaPhalo kaTshiwo, uqhubekile wadibanisa izizwe ngezizwe phantsi kwesizwe samaXhosa.
4.1 Ukusekwa kwezizwe ngezizwe
Zininzi izizwe eziphantsi kwesizwe samaXhosa, uninzi lwazo zikho ngaphambi kokumanyana phantsi kwesizwe samaXhosa. Ngezantsi ezinye zazo, olu luhlu aluphelelanga nangayiphi na indlela.
4.1.1 Isizwe samaGcaleka
Imbali yesizwe samaGcaleka ithatha inguqu ebonakalayo ngokuhlukana kwayo namaZulu. Olu qhekeko lwenzeka ngexesha likaKumkani uPhalo, isinyanya esasihlonitshwa samaXhosa. Ukuqala kwam ukuva ngeKumkani yamandulo kwaba yimibuliso ethi “Mzi kaPhalo”, itolika ngqo kwiNdlu kaPhalo ebonisa igalelo layo.
Ngokunganeliseki bubunkokheli bamaZulu, amaGcaleka, ekunye namanye amaqela amaXhosa, athatha isigqibo sokuzenzela eyawo indlela, nto leyo eyakhokelela ekubunjweni kweziduko ezahlukeneyo ezifana namaBhaca, amaNgqika, amaThembu, amaMpondomise, amaMfengu, amaMpondo namaBomvana.AmaGcaleka Isizwe, phantsi kobunkokheli bukaNkosi uGcaleka, savela njengesinye sezizwe ezibalaseleyo nezinamandla kwisizwe samaXhosa.
Baseka inqaba yabo eMpuma Koloni, baba ngabagcini bomhlaba nabakhuseli babantu babo. Isizwe samaGcaleka sadlala indima ebalulekileyo kwimizabalazo echasene nemikhosi yamakoloniyali, sixhathisa ukungenelela kunye nokulwela ukugcina ukuzimela nezithethe zabo.
Namhlanje, isizwe samaGcaleka, kunye nezinye izizwe zamaXhosa, baqhubeleka nokuwonga imvelaphi yabo etyebileyo kwaye benegalelo kumfanekiso odlamkileyo woluntu lwaseMzantsi Afrika. Izithethe zabo, ulwimi, neenkolelo zabo zesithethe zisebenza njengobungqina bokomelela nomoya wabo.
4.1.2 Ukudalwa kwesizwe samaBhaca
Phakathi kweziduko ezaphuma kuqhekeko lwamaXhosa-Zulu, isizwe samaBhaca sinendawo ebalaseleyo. Bekhokelwe yiNkosi uBhaca, bathathe uhambo lokuqina nokuzimisela olwathi lwabumba ikamva labo elikhethekileyo kwisizwe samaXhosa. AmaBhaca ahlala kwimixawuka yeMpuma Koloni, eqhelana nendalo yawo kwaye elima unxulumano olusondeleyo nomhlaba.
Isizwe samaBhaca sidume ngezithethe ezindele nzulu, kuquka isinxibo saso, umculo, umdaniso kunye nezithethe zomlomo. Iintsomi zabo ezityebileyo, ukubalisa amabali, kunye neenkolelo zabo zasemoyeni ziyinxalenye ebalulekileyo yenkcubeko yamaXhosa, zinegalelo ekugcinweni nasekubhiyozeleni iLifa labo elilodwa.
Isizwe samaBhaca sishiye inqaku elingacimekiyo kwisizwe samaXhosa. Abaphumi-mkhosi babo, ababedume ngobukroti nobugorha basemkhosini, badlala indima ebalulekileyo ekubumbeni imbali yaloo mmandla. Bayikhusela imihlaba yabo kwizoyikiso zangaphandle kwaye badlala indima ebalulekileyo ekuchaseni ulawulo lobukoloniyali.
Namhlanje, amaBhaca aqhubeleka nokufaka isandla kuphuhliso lwentlalo noqoqosho eMzantsi Afrika, egqwesa kwiinkalo ngeenkalo kwaye exhasa ilifa lenkcubeko yawo. Ukudalwa kwesizwe samaBhaca kububungqina bokuqina nomoya ongagungqiyo wamaXhosa. Uhambo lwabo ukusuka kuMbindi Afrika ukuya eMzantsi Afrika, ukudibana kwabo namaKhoisan, kunye nokwahlukana kwabo kubukumkani bamaZulu kuqaqambisa ukuntsonkotha nokwahluka kweMbali yabo.
4.1.3. Ukuvela kwesizwe sikaNgqika.
Isizwe sakwaNgqika, esasikhokelwa nguNkosi uNgqika, savela njengelinye lamaqela abalaseleyo ngeli xesha lesiphithiphithi sezobupolitika. UNkosi uNgqika wayesaziwa ngobunkokeli obuqinileyo nobudlelwane bakhe bobuchule, nto leyo eyavumela isizwe sikaNgqika ukuba sibe nempembelelo yaso kuloo mmandla.
Badlala indima ebalulekileyo ekuxhathiseni ukwanda kobukoloniyali kwabemi baseBritani namaDatshi, belwela ukukhusela umhlaba wabo kunye nokugcina ilifa lenkcubeko yabo. Imbali yesizwe sikaNgqika ithungelana nemizabalazo ebanzi yamaXhosa echasene nobukoloniyali nengcinezelo. Baye bajongana nemiceli mngeni emininzi, equka ukuhluthwa umhlaba, ukusetyenzwa ngenkani, kunye nokwamkelwa kweenkcubeko.
Ngaphandle kobu bunzima, isizwe sakwaNgqika namanye amaXhosa akwazile ukuzigcina iimpawu nezithethe zawo ezahlukileyo. Imbali yawo isisikhumbuzo sokuqina nonyamezelo lwamaXhosa xa ejamelene nobunzima.
Ngokuqonda ukuvela kwesizwe sakwaNgqika, sifumana ulwazi olubalulekileyo ngemvelaphi yembali yamaXhosa kunye nephulo lawo eliqhubekayo lokufuna ukuzimela nokuzingca ngenkcubeko. Esi sahluko sinikezelwe kubo bonke abathandi bembali, amaXhosa kunye nabemi boMzantsi Afrika abafuna ukuqonda nzulu ngemvelaphi yembali yamaXhosa kunye nobutyebi bamacandelwana awo ahlukeneyo. Ijonge ukunika ingxelo ebanzi ngokuvela kwesizwe sikaNgqika kumxholo obanzi wembali yamaXhosa, ikhanyise ngamagalelo, imizabalazo, noloyiso lwaso ukutyhubela iinkulungwane.
4.1.4. Ukusekwa kwesizwe sabaThembu.
AmaXhosa ekuqaleni ayemanyene phantsi kwegunya elinamandla, elikhokelwa yinkosi okanye inkosi. Nangona kunjalo, ungquzulwano lwangaphakathi noxinzelelo lwangaphandle ekugqibeleni lwakhokelela ekuqhekekeni kwamaXhosa abe ziziduko ezininzi ezahlukeneyo. Enye yezi zizwe yayingabaThembu.
UNgubengcuka ebedume ngobunkokeli obulumkileyo nezakhono zakhe kwezozakuzo. Wakwazi ukujongana nemeko yezopolitiko entsonkothileyo yelo xesha, esenza umanyano kwaye ethethathethana namakoloniyali amabini aseBritane kunye nesizwe samaXhosa. Phantsi kolawulo lwakhe isizwe sabaThembu sakhula, saba sesinye seziduko ezinefuthe nehlonitshwa kumaXhosa.
Namhlanje, isizwe sabaThembu sithe gqolo ukugcina uluvo oluqinileyo lokuzazi ngokwenkcubeko nokuzingca ngembali yabo. Banegalelo elikhulu kuluntu loMzantsi Afrika, abantu abaziwayo abafana noNelson Mandela kunye noWalter Sisulu bengamalungu esizwe sabaThembu. Ukusekwa kwesizwe sabaThembu bubungqina bokuqina nokuziqhelanisa namaXhosa.
Iqaqambisa imvelaphi yembali entsonkothileyo yamaXhosa, ukusuka ekufudukeni kwawo kuMbindi Afrika njengaBantu, ukusebenzisana kwawo namaKhoisan, nokwahlukana kwawo kumaZulu. Ukuqonda ukusekwa kwesizwe sabaThembu kubalulekile ekutyhileni ubutyebi bembali yamaXhosa, kwaye busebenza njengesikhumbuzo sendalo eyahlukeneyo nethungelanayo yelifa lenkcubeko yaseMzantsi Afrika.
4.1.5. Ukusekwa kwesizwe samaMpondomise.
Isizwe samaMpondomise, esikhokelwa yiNkosi uMpondombini, sivele njengelinye lamaqela aziwayo emva koqhekeko. Bazinza kumhlaba ochumileyo nochumileyo waseMpuma Koloni, apho baseka indawo yabo eyahluk
AmaMpondomise aye aduma ngobuchule bawo bezolimo, belima izityalo ezifana nombona namazimba, nto leyo engazange igcine indawo yabo kuphela kodwa inegalelo kuqoqosho lwesiXhosa ngokubanzi. Ngalo lonke ixesha lobukho baso, isizwe samaMpondomise sajongana nemingeni emininzi, kuquka iingxabano neziduko ezingabamelwane kunye nokungenelwa kwamathanga aseYurophu.
Nangona kukho le miqobo, amaMpondomise ahlala eqinile kwaye eqinile ekulondolozeni ilifa lenkcubeko yawo. Baqhubeka bedlulisela izithethe zabo zemveli, iimbali zomlomo, kunye nezithethe ukusuka kwesinye isizukulwana ukuya kwesinye, ukuqinisekisa ukusinda kobuntu babo obukhethekileyo. Namhlanje, isizwe samaMpondomise sibubungqina bembali etyebileyo kunye neenkcubeko ezahlukeneyo zamaXhosa.
Izithethe zabo ezahlukeneyo, iinkolelo, kunye negalelo labo liyaqhubeka ukubumba umzobo woluntu lwaseMzantsi Afrika. Njengabathandi bembali, amaXhosa nabemi boMzantsi Afrika, kufuneka sikuxabise kwaye sikubhiyozele ukusekwa kwesizwe samaMpondomise njengesiganeko esibalulekileyo kuhambo lwamaXhosa ukusuka kuMbindi Afrika ukuya eMzantsi Afrika.
4.1.6. Imvelaphi yesizwe samaMfengu.
Ndineenkumbulo ezintle zomhlobo wam ebuntwaneni waseDrayini, owayekhe wathetha ngomdla wokutyelela izizalwane zakhe "emaMfengwini", ebhekisa ngendawo yaseMfengus. Emva phaya, oku kwakungabalulekanga kangako kum, kodwa mva nje yonke into yahamba kakuhle. Ngenxa yokuba iDrayini iyilali ephantsi kweDutywa, xa uZola ebhekisa emaMfengwini wachaza indawo engaseGcuwa. Xa kuqwalaselwa imvelaphi yembali yamaMfengu, yonke into ngoku iyahamba.
Ngo-1828, iqela labaMbo labalekela eGcuwa, libaleka loo mbhodamo waseMfecane. Besuka kwintlambo yoMlambo uThukela kwindawo ebizwa ngokuba yiKwaZulu-Natal yanamhlanje, babeyinxalenye yeqela lesiNguni labantu abathetha isiBantu.
Ukuhlala kwabo kwingingqi yaseCiskei nase Transkei kwabavumela ukuba baphumelele njengamafama nabarhwebi. Bamkela inkolo yobuKrestu nemfundo yaseNtshona, bavelisa ezinye zeenkokeli zezopolitiko zamandulo phakathi kwabemi baseKapa. Namhlanje, bayinxalenye ebalulekileyo yoluntu lwaseMzantsi Afrika, beqhayisa ngembali nenkcubeko eyahlukeneyo nenempumelelo. Ngelixa abanye bezibandakanya kwisizwe sakwaXhosa, abanye baye bagcina ubuni nokuzimela kwabo.
Uhambo lwesizwe samaMfengu lunemiqobo emininzi kunye namathuba kweli xesha langoku. Umceli mngeni ophambili abajongene nawo bubudlelwane babo obuntsonkothileyo namaXhosa, azizizalwane zawo kunye nababefudula beziintshaba zabo. Abanye baye bazibandakanya nesizwe samaXhosa, lo gama abanye bezingomb' isifuba ngokuba bangoobani nokuzimela.
Umzabalazo wabo wokufumana umhlaba kunye namalungelo ezopolitiko ibe lidabi elihlala lihleli ngokuchasene nocalucalulo, inkqubo yeBantustan, kunye norhulumente wasemva kocalucalulo. Ngelixa abanye bethethelele ilizwe labo, abanye baye balandela imdibaniselwano kuMzantsi Afrika wedemokhrasi, bezama ukumelwa ngokufanelekileyo.
Ngaphaya koko, inkqubela-phambili yentlalo noqoqosho lwesizwe samaMfengu sibunjwe lilifa lembali eyodwa, iinqobo zenkcubeko kunye nemingeni yanamhlanje. Ngelixa abanye befumene impumelelo ebalaseleyo kunye nokuphawulwa kwiinkalo ezahlukeneyo, abanye basaqhubeka besilwa nobuhlwempu kunye nokujongelwa phantsi.
Isizwe samaMfengu, nenkcubeko yaso eyohlukeneyo netyebileyo, sityebisa ngokubonakalayo ukuntsonkotha nodlamko loluntu lwaseMzantsi Afrika. Ziye zadlala indima ephambili ekuxonxeni imbali nezopolitiko zalo mmandla, nto leyo eshiya uphawu olungacimekiyo kumfanekiso wesizwe.
4.1.7. Uphuhliso lwezizwe zamaMpondo.
Intsebenziswano phakathi kwamaXhosa namaKhoisan ibe nefuthe elibonakalayo kuphuhliso lwesizwe samaMpondo. Oku kudityaniswa kwenkcubeko kube negalelo ekufanisweni kwesizwe samaMpondo.
Emva kokoyiswa kwabo yinkokeli yamaZulu edumileyo uShaka, isizwe samaMpondo safumana isiphithiphithi esimandla kunye nokugxothwa. Ixesha leMfecane lizise imiceli mngeni ebalulekileyo kumaMpondo, nanjengoko aye anyanzeleka ukuba afuduke kwaye noluntu lwawo lwaqhekeka. Basokola ukujamelana nokuphulukana nomhlaba wabo nendlela yokuphila yesithethe. Uninzi lwamaMpondo lwaluthe saa kwiingingqi ezahlukeneyo, nto leyo eyenza kwanzima ukugcina ubunye nobuzwe babo.
Nangona kunjalo, ngo-1828, phantsi kobunkokheli beFaku enkulu, amaMpondo afumana indlela yokuphinda alungelelanise kwaye avuke kwakhona, nangona kwakukho ubunzima bangaphambili. UFaku ubonakalise ukuqonda okumangalisayo ngokufunda kwimbali kunye nokwamkela ezinye zeendlela eziyimpumelelo zemfazwe ezazisetyenziswa ngumkhosi kaShaka, ezazikhokelele ekuweni kwawo ngaphambili. Loo nto yabangela ukuba amaMpondo aphumelele phantsi kolawulo lukaFaku.
Ngo-1860, inani labo lakhula laya kutsho kwi-100,000, kwaye baye baba lilizwe eloyikekayo elinamandla okuzibandakanya kurhwebo nabarhwebi baseYurophu ngeminyaka yoo-1860.
Ngelishwa, amaMpondo azakuphinda ajongane neminye imingeni aze ekugqibeleni anikezele kuCecil Rhodes, ubukhulu becala ngenxa yongquzulwano lwangaphakathi kumaqela abo, nto leyo eyabenza babuthathaka. Nakubeni kukho la magingxigingxi, amaMpondo abonakalise ubukroti obumangalisayo njengoko ebenyamezele kwaye eqhelana neemeko zawo ezintsha. Ngenzondelelo babambelela kwilifa labo lenkcubeko, begcina ulwimi lwabo, izithethe nezithethe zabo, nto leyo eyadlala indima ebalulekileyo ekugcineni uluntu lwabo luphila phakathi kombhodamo wokufuduka.

4.1.8. Ukusekwa kwesizwe samaBomvana.
Njengelungu lesizwe samaTshezi, ingcambu yam ndiyilanda kwisizwe samaBomvana. “Tshezi, Jalamba, Mqal’ ongangenduku, Njilo-njilo, iNkonjane ebhab’ emafini, iinzwana zakwaBomvana, iNyoka emnyama ecanda isiziba, inkosi ezibutheng’ubokhosi Zinto ezityhafileyo zithi zidla umcuku. imbali yethu ngokwenza "ukuzithutha".
Andizange ndiyiqonde ncam into yokuba sihambe ngawo onke amagama esiwenzayo de ndabona ukuba kwizinyanya zam uNjilo ngomnye, kungoko kugxininiswa nokuphindaphindwa kwendumiso ethi "Njilo Njilo". I-Bomovana idunyiswa kakhulu kwinkqubo kwaye ibonisa ikhonkco..
AmaBomvana agxothwa ngenkani emaMpondweni ayokuzinza kwindawo esempuma yomlambo uMbashe. Bakha ubuhlobo namaGcaleka baza bafumana imvume kuKumkani uHintsa.
Banonxibelelwano lwembali namanye amaqela afana namaMpondomise, AmaXesibe, AbakwaMkhize, namaMpondo, njengoko besabelana ngeenkcubeko ezifanayo.

4.2. Hintsa kaKhawuta: IKumkani enkulu yesizwe samaXhosa.
UHintsa kaKhawuta, okanye uKumkani uHintsa, wayeyingqwayi-ngqwayi yobuKumkani bamaXhosa, obasekwa nguyisemkhulu uKumkani uTshawe. Ulawulo lwakhe, ukusukela ngo-1820 ukuya kutsho ngo-1835, babubona ubuKumkani bakwaXhosa bukwincopho yabo, busuka kumlambo uMbhashe kumazantsi oMthatha ukuya kutsho kumlambo iGamtoos eMazantsi eKoloni. U-Hintsa wongamela enye yezona zikumkani zoyikekayo kuMazantsi e-Afrika, ekugqibeleni wabandakanyeka kungquzulwano lwenkulungwane elide kunye noBukhosi baseBritane kunye nokwanda kwabo kulo mmandla.
UbuKumkani bamaXhosa bebulawulwa zizindlu ezimbini, iNdlu yamaGcaleka okanye iNdlu enkulu, esebenza njengendlu elawulayo, kunye neNdlu yamaRharhabe okanye indlu yasekunene, njengendlu yesibini ephezulu. Ngexesha likaHintsa, amaphondo afana nabaThembu, AmaMpondo, AmaBomvana, AmaBhaca, namaMpondomise aye alivuma igunya lobukhosi bakwaXhosa. La mazwe, nangona ayengamaXhosa, agcina ukuzimela kwawo ebukhosini.
UHintsa owazalwa ngeminyaka yoo-1780, engunyana kaKhawuta kaGcaleka, ephuma kumnombo wabalawuli abadumileyo. Wangena ezihlangwini zikayisekazi uNqoko kaGcaleka, iKumkani ebambeleyo, waza wathweswa isithsaba ngokusesikweni ngo-1820. UHintsa uhlala efaniswa nokhokho wakhe obalaseleyo, uTshawe kaNkosiyamntu, owaseka ubukumkani bamaXhosa ekupheleni kwenkulungwane ye-17 ngokoyisa amaqela alwayo. UHintsa wafumana ilifa lobukumkani obunenkqubela nobukhulu, awathi wabugcina ngobuchule waza wabomeleza esebenzisa idiplomacy kunye nobuchule bakhe kwezomkhosi. Abantu bakhe babemhlonela kakhulu, kwaye impembelelo yakhe yadlulela ngaphaya kobukumkani bakhe kwezinye izikumkani neenkosi zaseAfrika. Kwaneentshaba zakhe, ezifana namaNgesi namaBhulu, zaliqonda igunya lakhe yaye zawahlonela amandla akhe.
Phantsi kobunkokheli bukaHintsa, umkhosi wamaXhosa wawungowona mkhulu nowoyikekayo kuMazantsi eAfrika. Isicwangciso sakhe somkhosi sasigxile ekushukumeni, uhlaselo olothusayo, kunye namaqhinga okubhukuqa. Kunokuba abandakanyeke kungquzulwano oluthe ngqo, uHintsa wakhetha ukungcungcuthekisa nokugqogqa iintshaba zakhe emgama. Umkhosi wakhe wawuquka amajoni aphuma kwizizwe nezizwe ngezizwe ezamlandela ubunkokheli nomyalelo wakhe. Kwakhona wafumana inkxaso kumahlakani kunye namasebe kwezinye izikumkani zaseAfrika ngamaxesha emfazwe.
Ngexesha lolawulo lukaHintsa, ubuKumkani bamaXhosa bazifumana bungquzulana neKoloni yaseKoloni, eyayiphantsi kolawulo lwamaNgesi. Ngaphezu koko, isizwe samaXhosa siye sajongana nengxabano yangaphakathi ngenxa yeemfazwe zobukhaya phakathi kweenkosi kunye nokuthontelana kwezizwe ezimbacu zisuka eMfecane. Ezi zinto zakhokelela kuthotho lweemfazwe, ezaziwa ngokuba ziiMfazwe zaseMmandla okanye iiMfazwe zamaXhosa, ezathatha inkulungwane.
Esona siganeko sibalulekileyo esathi savusa iMfazwe yeSixth Frontier War, nekwaziwa njengeMfazwe kaHintsa, kukubulawa kwenkosi ephezulu yamaXhosa liqela lamakhomanda kurhulumente waseKapa. Esi senzo sogonyamelo saxhokonxa amaXhosa, nto leyo eyakhokelela ekubeni umkhosi wamadoda akwishumi lamawaka, owawukhokelwa yinkosi yaseRharhabe uMaqoma, uqalise ukuhlasela iKoloni yaseKoloni. Ekugqibeleni amaBritani angenelela, amisa inkqubela yawo emva kokuphangwa okuninzi, ukutshiswa nokuphulukana nobomi babo.
Olu ngquzulwano lwaluphawulwa ngomlo okhohlakeleyo, ophumela kwiingxwelerha eziqatha kumacala omabini. UMhlekazi uHarry Smith kunye noSir Benjamin d'Urban, ababekhokela imikhosi yaseBritane, bafuna uNcedo kuHintsa ukuze bahlasele iinkosi zamaRharhabe. Ekuqaleni ezimisele ukuxhasa amaNgesi ngewaka lamadoda, kwacaca ukuba uHintsa akasayi kungcatsha iinkokeli zakhe zamaXhosa. Oku kukhokelele ekubeni u-d'Urban asebenzise njengesizathu sokubhengeza imfazwe noHintsa.
Irhuluneli yaseBritane uMhlekazi uBenjamin D'Urban waqubisana nokumkani uHintsa ngomkhosi omkhulu, embeka uxanduva lokuhlasela iKoloni yaseKapa ngenxa yegunya analo kwisizwe sakwaXhosa kunye neenkosi zaso. Kunokuba iwandise ungquzulwano, uHintsa wakhetha ukwenza iingxoxo zoxolo namaNgesi. NgoMeyi 1835, uHintsa, ephelekwa ngamajoni aseBritani awayekhokelwa yiRhuluneli uHarry Smith, waba nenxaxheba kwiingxoxo zoxolo. Nangona kunjalo, iimfuno zamaBritane zabonakala zingekho ngqiqweni kwaye zijonge ukuthotywa kunye nokumenza buthathaka uHintsa.
Uthe akukubona oku, uHintsa akavumanga ukunikezela, wagqiba kwelokuba aziphelise iingxoxo. Njengoko wayehamba, amajoni aseBritane ambamba kwaye ambamba njengendawo. Bamnyanzela ukuba ahambe kunye nomkhosi waseBritani, emfaka ekuthuthunjisweni nasekuphathweni kakubi. Ngeli xesha, ubukumkani bakhe bachithwa yimikhosi yaseBritani, eyakhokelela ekutshatyalalisweni kweelali, ukuphulukana nobomi, kunye nokuhluthwa kweenkomo. Ngaphandle kwamalinge amaninzi okusaba, uHintsa waphinda wabanjwa wabethwa. NgoMeyi 12, 1835, uHintsa wakwazi ukukhululeka waza wabalekela kumlambo okufuphi.
Elandelwa nguSmith namadoda akhe, wadutyulwa wabulawa ngasemva. Kwisenzo sokugqibela sobukrwada, uSmith wayalela ukuba zinqunyulwe iindlebe zikaHintsa njengobungqina bokubhubha kwakhe. Intloko yakhe nayo yakhutshwa kwaye yathathwa njengendebe eyoyikekayo. Umzimba kaHintsa ushiywe ungangcwatywanga, logama intloko yakhe kamva yabekwa kwindawo yolondolozo lwembali eBritane.
Ukubhubha kukaHintsa kume njengesiganeko esibuhlungu nesilihlazo kwimbali yamaXhosa nakuBukhosi bamaNgesi. Yayibonakalisa ukuphela kokuxhathisa nokuzimela kwamaXhosa, inika ithuba lolawulo lobukoloniyali nengcinezelo. Nangona kunjalo, ilifa likaHintsa lihlala lihleli kwiinkumbulo nakwinkcubeko yamaXhosa, emthatha njengeqhawe elifela ukholo.
Useluphawu olunamandla lwesidima somAfrika, ulawulo lwakhe, kunye nomthombo wenkuthazo kumzabalazo wokulwa ubukoloniyali nocalucalulo. Emva kwephulo elide lamaXhosa norhulumente woMzantsi Afrika, intloko kaHintsa yada yabuyiselwa eMzantsi Afrika ngo-1996. Yangcwatywa ngembeko epheleleyo kumhlaba wooyise, nto leyo eyavumela umoya wakhe ukuba ufumane uxolo ekugqibeleni.

Isahluko sesihlanu, uMbutho wezoPolitiko kunye nobuNkokheli kwizizwe zamaXhosa.

Isahluko sesihlanu, amaSebe oLawulo lweMveli.
Amaqumrhu olawulo lwemveli adlale indima ebalulekileyo ekubumbeni imbali nobuni bomXhosa waseMzantsi Afrika. Ezi zakhiwo ziye zavela kwiinkulungwane kwaye ziqhubeka zibambe ukubaluleka okukhulu kuze kube namhlanje.
Izigqeba zolawulo lwemveli phakathi kwamaXhosa ziphawulwa kukugxininiswa okumandla kubuzalwana nasekuthathweni kwezigqibo zoluntu. Inkosi okanye inkosi, edla ngokubizwa ngokuba yiNkosi, idlala indima ebalulekileyo ekugcineni ucwangco nokusombulula iingxabano phakathi koluntu. Inkosi incediswa libhunga labadala, abanika isikhokelo nobulumko obusekelwe kubutyebi bamava nolwazi abanalo.
Ngaphaya koko, amaXhosa anonxulumano olunzulu nemimoya yawo yezinyanya, ekukholelwa ukuba inegalelo kubomi babo bemihla ngemihla kwaye inika isikhokelo kwiinkokeli zabo. Imisitho yesiNtu kunye nezithethe, ezinjengokubuyisela okanye ukugoduka kwizinyanya, ziyaluqinisa olu nxulumano lwasemoyeni kwaye zomeleze iqhina phakathi kwabaphilayo nongasekhoyo.
Ngelixa izigqeba zolawulo zala maxesha ziye zaziswa eMzantsi Afrika, iinkqubo zolawulo lwemveli zamaXhosa ziqhubekile nokubamba ixabiso elibalulekileyo lenkcubeko kunye nomfuziselo. Zisebenza njengesikhumbuzo sembali etyebileyo kunye nelifa lemveli yamaXhosa kwaye zinika imvakalelo yokuzazi nokuba ngowabantu bamaXhosa.
5.1. Iindima noxanduva lweenkokeli zezindlu.
Isizwe samaXhosa siquka iindidi ngeendidi zezizwe neziduko ezabelana ngonxibelelwano ngomnombo nenkcubeko yazo. Embindini wesi sizwe ziinkokeli, ekudala zikhonza njengeenkokeli ezibekekileyo zezizwe nezizwe zazo. Aba bantu babalaseleyo ngokwembali babedlala indima ebalulekileyo ekubumbeni imeko yezopolitiko, yezentlalo, neyenkolo yamaXhosa.
Ukutyhubela imbali, iinkokeli zezizwe neentsapho ziye zaphathiswa iimbopheleleko ezibalulekileyo. Baye bema njengabameli abaluqilima, bethethathethana kunye nonxibelelwano nezinye izizwe, iziduko namagunya obukoloniyali. Xa zinyanisekile, ezi nkokeli ziye zasebenza ngenkuthalo ukugcina umanyano, imvisiswano nentlalo-ntle yabantu bazo ngokucombulula ngobuchule iingxabano, ngokumisela imithetho, nokuqinisekisa ukukhuselwa komntu wonke.
Isizwe kunye neenkokheli zezizwe nazo zibambe indima engcwele kwizithethe zenkcubeko yazo. Zichophele ngokunyanisekileyo iinkundla zemveli, imisitho, nezithethe ezakha isiseko sentlalo kaXhosa. Ukususela kumasiko abalulekileyo okwaluka, ukutshata nokungcwatywa, ezi nkokeli zibe negalelo elikhulu ekuxhaseni nasekuqhubeleni phambili izithethe ezichaza amaXhosa. Ngokwenza oko, baye bakhulisa intlonipho enzulu yelifa leminyanya, intembeko engagungqiyo kwisizwe, nokuzinikela ngokungagungqiyo kulwimi lwesixhosa nesinxibo.
Ngokuhambelana nenkqubo yolandelelwano, isizwe kunye neenkokheli zezindlu zifumene izikhundla zazo ezihloniphekileyo kooyise okanye ezinye izalamane zamadoda, ziqinisekisa ukuqhubekeka kunye nokuzinza ngaphakathi kobunkokeli babo.
KuMzantsi Afrika wedemokhrasi ukufaneleka kweenkokheli zomthonyama kuyathandatyuzwa. Ukufaneleka kweenkosi okanye inkosi kuye kwajongwa ngabaninzi, ngakumbi ngenxa yemali eninzi yabarhafi abayifumanayo, ibe nefuthe elincinane ekudambiseni intlupheko nakwiindawo ezisemaphandleni abazimeleyo. Oku kuphinda kuzise umbuzo obalulekileyo kubarhafi kwisizwe siphela abanganxulumananga neMpuma Koloni okanye amaXhosa, kutheni kufuneka bathwale ubunzima bento engabakhathaziyo?
Iinkokeli zemveli ubukhulu becala zithethelela uluntu nezizwe zazo, zingamelanga ngokupheleleyo uluntu lwelizwe lonke, kutheni ke kufuneka ukuba lo mthwalo uthwaliswe ngabantu abangafumani nzuzo kwiinkokeli zemveli?
5.2. Ulawulo lweClan kunye neDynamics zamandla.
Umthetho-siseko wezikhundla eziphezulu wakha isiseko solawulo lwesizwe samaXhosa kunye nokutshintsha kwamandla.
Isizwe esinokuthi silandele umnombo waso sibuyele koyena mkhulu okanye unyana wamazibulo wokhokho sinegunya phezu kwezindlu, sinelungelo lobunkokheli newonga. Esi sizwe sikwathatha uxanduva lokukhusela nokukhokela iziduko. Kwinkcubeko yamaXhosa isizwe esiphethe olu xanduva saziwa ngokuba yi “Ndlu enkulu”.
Abangobagcini bezithethe nemilinganiselo kuphela kodwa bakwangabalamli ekuzinziseni iingxabano nokwenza izigqibo ezibalulekileyo zesizwe siphela. Indima yabo njenge "Ndlu enkulu" ayibandakanyi ubunkokeli kuphela kodwa ikwaxhasa izithethe zomoya nezenkcubeko ezichaza abantu besizwe, ziqinisekisa ukuqhubeka nokugcinwa kwelifa labo ukwenzela izizukulwana ezizayo. Esi sikhundla sibekekileyo siza nentlonipho enkulu, kodwa kwanomthwalo onzima, njengoko isizwe sijonge kubo ukuze bafumane isikhokelo kunye nomanyano ngamaxesha okubhiyozelwa kunye nomngeni.

Uluhlu lwezizalwana zamaXhosa kunye nokutshintsha kwamagunya akumiselwa kuphela ngumgaqo wezikhundla eziphezulu kodwa ukwaphenjelelwa ziziganeko zembali kunye nobudlelwane bezopolitiko. Iimfazwe nokruthakruthwano lwemihlaba, iinkomo nobunkokeli ziye zakhokelela kwiyantlukwano nosukuzwano phakathi kwezizwe ezithile. Ukongeza, izivumelwano ezenziwe nezinye izizwe, iziduko, okanye amagunya obukoloniyali ziye zasichaphazela isidima nefuthe lazo kumaXhosa.
5.3. Inguquko yobunkokheli kwintlalo yamaXhosa anamhlanje.
Iinkokheli zezizwe nezizalwana ezaziwa ngokuba ziinkosi okanye iinkosi zibe nefuthe elibonakalayo kwezopolitiko, uluntu, nenkolo kumaXhosa. Badlale indima ebalulekileyo ekukhuthazeni ubudlelwane namanye amaqela namagunya obukoloniyali, nto leyo eshiya ifuthe elihlala lihleli kwintlalo yamaXhosa ngokubanzi.
Nangona kunjalo, uluntu lwamaXhosa lukhe lwagagana nefuthe elibi lobukoloniyali nocalucalulo. Ezi nkqubo zaphazamisa zatshintsha izithethe nezithethe zamaXhosa, zazisa iindlela ezintsha zolawulo nolawulo.
Kwimingeni efana nokuhluthwa komhlaba, ukurhafiswa, ukufudukela kwelinye ilizwe, imfundo, kunye nokuchasa, iinkokeli zamaXhosa kuye kwafuneka zilungelelanise kwaye ziphendule ngokufanelekileyo. Ezinye iinkokeli zakhetha ukusebenzisana noorhulumente bamakholoniyali kunye nocalucalulo, ngelixa ezinye bezichasa kwaye bezichasa.
Ngaphaya koko, emva kokuphela kocalucalulo ngo-1994, amaXhosa angena kwinguqu yedemokhrasi eyathi yazisa amathuba nemingeni kumaXhosa nakwiinkokeli zawo. Ngelixa amaXhosa ayezuza amalungelo angakumbi ezopolitiko, ukumelwa, ukufikelela kwimfundo, impilo, kunye nophuhliso, kwanyanzeleka ukuba ajongane nemiba engxamisekileyo efana nentlupheko, intswela-ngqesho, ukungalingani, ubuqhophololo nobundlobongela.
Iinkokeli zamaXhosa zithe zazifumana zikwimeko ecekethekileyo yokulungelelanisa izinto ezilindelekileyo kunye neemfuno zabantu bazo kunye neemfuno kunye nemimiselo yombuso wentando yesininzi. Ukongeza kwezi zinto zembali, intlalo kaXhosa iye yaphenjelelwa naziimpembelelo zokudityaniswa kwehlabathi nokuphucuka kwezinto. Ezi nkqubo ziye zabhentsisa amaXhosa neenkokeli zawo kwiingcinga ezintsha, iinqobo ezisemgangathweni, neempembelelo, nto leyo ekhokelele kwiyantlukwano enkulu phakathi kwesizwe samaXhosa.

Nanjengoko amaXhosa esamkela iindlela zokuphila, ubuni, neminqweno eyahlukileyo, iinkokeli zamaXhosa zicelwa umngeni ekulawuleni oku kuntsokotha nokungafani, ngelixa zikwajonga ubucukubhede bokhuphiswano nentsebenziswano namanye amaqela nabadlali beqonga.
5.4. Impembelelo yoMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika kumasiko nemithetho yamaXhosa.
UMgaqo-siseko nemithetho yoMzantsi Afrika ibe nefuthe elimandla kwiinkqubo zomthetho zemveli zamaXhosa. Oku kuye kwaba kokubini okulungileyo kunye nokubi.
Phambi kokufika kolawulo lobukoloniyali, amaXhosa ayenemithetho yesiNtu neenkqubo zobulungisa ezazilawula uluntu lwawo. Nangona kunjalo, ngokusekwa kwenkqubo yezomthetho ephakathi phantsi kolawulo lwamaBhritane kunye nolungelelwaniso lwemithetho olwalandelayo, iinkqubo zomthetho zemveli zamaXhosa zenze utshintsho olubonakalayo.
Enye yeempembelelo ezinkulu zoMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika kwiinkqubo zomthetho zesiXhosa kukuvunywa komthetho wesintu. UMgaqo-siseko uyawuvuma umthetho wesintu njengomthombo osebenzayo wowiso-mthetho kwaye uqaqambisa ukubaluleka kokugcinwa kwezithethe zenkcubeko nezemveli. Oku kwamkelwa kuvumele imiba ethile yomthetho wesintu ukuba ibandakanywe kubume bomthetho obanzi waseMzantsi Afrika. La malungelo abe nefuthe elibonakalayo kwiinkqubo zomthetho zemveli kwaXhosa, njengoko enze ukuba kuphinde kuphononongwe izenzo nezithethe ezithile kumasiko awo emveli.
Ukongeza, inkqubo yezomthetho yaseMzantsi Afrika iseke iindlela zokusombulula iimbambano ngokungqinelana nomthetho wesintu. Ezi ndlela, kubandakanywa nokusekwa kweenkundla zemveli, zijolise ekugcineni imfezeko yezithethe zezomthetho zamaXhosa lo gama zisebenza ngaphakathi komgaqo-siseko obanzi.
Nangona kunjalo, kufanele kuqatshelwe ukuba ifuthe loMgaqo-siseko woMzantsi Afrika kunye nemithetho kwiinkqubo zomthetho zesiXhosa khange ibe nemingeni. Kubekho iingxoxo kunye nokungavisisani malunga nolungelelwaniso phakathi kokugcinwa kwezithethe zenkcubeko kunye nokugcinwa kwamalungelo omgaqo-siseko, ngakumbi kwiimeko apho izenzo zemveli zinokungqubana nemithetho-siseko yomgaqo-siseko.
Ngokuphathelele kumthetho wolwaphulo-mthetho, ungquzulwano luye lwavela kwimiba engqongileyo efana nesohlwayo sokubethwa kunye nezohlwayo zesintu, ezinokuthi zichase ukwalelwa komgaqo-siseko wesohlwayo esikhohlakeleyo nesingenabuntu. Umceli-mngeni ulele ekubetheleleni ulungelelwaniso phakathi kokuhlonipha izithethe zenkcubeko kunye nokukhusela amalungelo omntu ngaphakathi kwesakhelo somthetho esibanzi.
Ngokomthetho wepropati, ungquzulwano luvela xa izenzo zemveli, ezinjengobunini bomhlaba ngokuhlangeneyo, zingqubana namalungelo epropati omntu ngamnye amkelwa ngumgaqo-siseko. Oku kukhokelele kumadabi omthetho antsonkothileyo kunye nesidingo sezisombululo ezitsha ezivala umsantsa phakathi kokugcinwa kwenkcubeko kunye nokhuseleko lomgaqo-siseko.
Impixano phakathi kwezithethe zamaXhosa kunye nomthetho wale mihla waseMzantsi Afrika ngumba oqhubekayo nontsokothileyo. Oku kudala ukruthakruthwano phakathi komnqweno wamaXhosa wokulondoloza ilifa lenkcubeko yawo kunye noxanduva lukarhulumente lokukhusela umntu eNkameni.
Isiko lokuthwala, apho amabhinqa aselula axhwilwa ukuze atshate, sesinye isiko lesintu elingqubana nomthetho nesaliwayo namhlanje. Kubandakanya ukuthatha intombazana okanye ibhinqa ngenkani ngokuchasene nentando yakhe, nto leyo edla ngokuphumela kwimitshato enyanzelwayo nokuphathwa kakubi ngokweemvakalelo nangokwasemzimbeni. Amatshantliziyo kunye nemibutho benze iinzame zokwazisa kunye nokumela ukupheliswa kwalo mkhwa.
Ngelixa ulwaluko lwamadoda emaXhoseni lusesemthethweni, kuye kwanda ukugxekwa kwesi siko ngenxa yobuninzi babakhwetha abathe babhubha okanye bajongana nezigulo zempilo, abanye beneziphene ezihlala zihleli. Ngo-2021, iDispatch Live inike ingxelo yokuba inani lokubhubha kwabakhwetha abangamaXhosa lifikelele ku-858 kwiminyaka elishumi elinesihlanu edlulileyo. Eli nani lothusayo liqhubekile nokunyuka, ligqitha kuma-900 ekupheleni kuka-2023. Lo mkhwa ugxininisa imfuneko engxamisekileyo yokwandiswa kolawulo kunye nokongamela inkqubo yolwaluko lwemveli.
Kukho iimpawu ezibonisa ukuba ungquzulwano lwemithetho yesiNtu kwaXhosa lusendleleni eya ekusonjululweni. Nangona kunjalo, endaweni yokuba umthetho wesintu uthathe indima ephambili nanini na xa kufanelekile, kunokwenzeka ngakumbi ukuba izinto zawo ziya kufakwa kumthetho wesizwe, nangona ngokukhululekileyo. Ngenxa yoko, izakhiwo zemveli ziya kuncipha kancinci ngokuhamba kwexesha.
Umba womthetho wesintu endiwufumana uyingxaki yindlela elawulwa ngayo yonke impahla engashukumiyo.
Le ndlela yokusebenza ikhokelele ekwehleni okumandla kutyalo-mali kwiindawo ezisemaphandleni eMzantsi Afrika njengoko utyalo-mali kwizakhiwo lungenalo ukhuseleko lwengqesho. Inkqubo yepropathi yoluntu emaphandleni aseMzantsi Afrika iyingozi kutyalo-mali kwaye ayihloniphi kubanini-propati basemaphandleni. Le nkqubo iqhwalelisa uphuhliso loqoqosho kwimimandla yasemaphandleni ngokudimaza utyalo-mali lwabucala kunye nokudodobalisa ushishino. Ibahlutha abanini-propati ukuzimela nokulawula umhlaba wabo, ibathintele ekuwusebenziseni ngokupheleleyo iinjongo zemveliso.
Ngaphaya koko, ukunqongophala kwamalungelo acacileyo obunini bomhlaba kuthintela ukukwazi ukufikelela kwityala kunye nemali-mboleko, nto leyo iqhwalelisa utyalo-mali kwaye inciphisa ukukhula koqoqosho. Ngokomthetho, abantu abaxhomekeke kwabanye ukuba baphathe imicimbi yabo bahlala bejamelana nemiqobog ukwenza izigqibo zabo, ikakhulu ngenxa yezinto ezifana nobudala, ukungakwazi kwengqondo, okanye ezinye iindlela zokungakwazi ukwenza umsebenzi. Inkqubo yepropathi yoluntu kwimimandla yasemaphandleni ithetha ukuba abantu abadala abasoloko belawula imicimbi yabo kangangeenkulungwane baswele amandla okulawula ii-asethi zabo.
Le nkqubo sisithuko kubanini bemihlaba yasemaphandleni ekufuneka babe nelungelo lokuthatha izigqibo ngomhlaba wabo kwaye baxhamle kusetyenziso lwawo. Ikhuthaza ukungalingani kwaye ithintele ukuqokelelwa kobutyebi kunye nempahla phakathi koluntu lwasemaphandleni. Lilonke, inkqubo yeepropathi zoluntu ezilalini zaseMzantsi Afrika iyingozi kutyalo-mali kwaye ijongela phantsi amalungelo kunye nesakhono sabanini beepropathi zasemaphandleni.
Le yenye yezinto ezimbalwa abangayiphoswa kuMzantsi Afrika wale mihla njengoko ibingumqobo omkhulu.
Isahluko sesiThandathu: IiNkcubeko neZenzo.

Isahluko 6, Ulwimi, iinkolelo kunye nelifa lemveli.
AmaXhosa awaneli nje ukwabelana ngokufana nabanye abantu besiNguni kunye noluntu ngokubanzi lwaBantu, koko baneempawu ezibahlulayo. Le yantlukwano ayipheleli nje ekubohluleni kwezinye izizwe zabeNguni koko nakwizizwe ngezizwe eziquka isizwe samaXhosa.
Inkcubeko etyebileyo yesizwe samaXhosa ibonakala kwisinxibo saso semveli, umculo, kunye nomxhentso, zinto ezo eziyinxalenye yobuntu baso. Oku kuzingca ngenkcubeko kunye nelifa lemveli kudlale indima ebonakalayo ekubumbeni umzi kaXhosa. Iimpahla zabo zemveli, umculo, kunye nomdaniso zibonisa uxhulumaniso lwabo olunzulu kwimbali yabo kunye nemilinganiselo yabo, ukubonelela ngentambo edibeneyo edibanisa uluntu kwizizukulwana. Oku kugcinwa nokubhiyozelwa kwelifa lenkcubeko yabo kusaqhubeka nokuba ngumthombo wokomelela nokomelela kumaXhosa.
Ukutya abakuqhelanisileyo ukuba bakuthathele ingqalelo njengesiseko ubukhulu becala kwakubunjwe yiminikelo ekhoyo phakathi kweendawo ezahlukeneyo, kungoko nangona uya kubona izinto ezininzi ezifanayo phakathi kwezitya kunye nezithethe kukho umahluko ofihlakeleyo ukusuka kwindawo ngeendawo.
Ukwahluka kwezithethe zamaXhosa kunokunxulunyaniswa nezithethe zomlomo eziguquguqukayo eziye zaba ngumthombo wolwazi kubantu baseAfrika kwiinkulungwane. Ekuqaleni, ndabona ukungabikho kweerekhodi ezibhaliweyo njengobuthathaka, obunokuthi buvule indlela yokuchazwa kakubi kunye nokuxhaphaza. Nangona kunjalo, ngoku ndiyaqonda ukuba oku kunqongophala kwamaxwebhu kwenze ukuba izithethe zamaXhosa ziguquke kwaye zihlale zibalulekile ekuphenduleni iinguqu kwintlalontle nakwimekobume.
Ubukho beengxelo ezibhaliweyo zamandulo buye bavelisa ucelomngeni kwabo bafuna ukubambelela ngokungqongqo kwiintsingiselo zabo zokoqobo kwihlabathi eliguqukayo. Abaphengululi kuye kwafuneka babonelele ngeetoliko ukuze le mibhalo ilungelelane namaxesha angoku, nto leyo endikrokrelayo ukuba sisizathu sokuba kukho iTestamente eNdala kunye neTestamente eNtsha, kunye neemvaba ngeemvaba ngeemvaba zamaKristu ezijolise ekukhonzeni abalandeli babo abathile ngokutolika izibhalo.
6.1. Ulwimi lwesiXhosa nonxibelelwano.
IsiXhosa, esikwabizwa ngokuba lulwimi lwesiXhosa, sibambe indawo ebalulekileyo njengolunye lweelwimi ezisemthethweni eMzantsi Afrika naseZimbabwe. Ikwiqela lesiNguni leelwimi zesiNtu, eziquka isiZulu, isiSwati, nesiNdebele. Kulo lonke elaseMpuma Koloni, eNtshona Koloni, eGauteng, nakwiphondo laseFreystata eMzantsi Afrika, nakwiindawo ezithile zaseZimbabwe naseLesotho, ulwimi lwesiXhosa luthethwa ngabantu abamalunga nezigidi ezilishumi elinesixhenxe.
Ulwimi lwesiXhosa lwenzeka ngeengcambu ngexesha lokufuduka kwabantu beNguni besuka kuMbindi naseMpuma Afrika besiya kumazantsi eAfrika phakathi kwenkulungwane yeshumi ukuya kweyeshumi elinesihlanu. Njengoko abantu beNguni babenxibelelana nama Khoikhoi kunye namaSan, abemi bomthonyama bommandla, badibanisa amagama abo kunye nokucofa izandi. Ekuhambeni kwexesha, kwavela amacandelwana ahlukeneyo, njengesiXhosa, isiZulu, isiSwati nesiNdebele, ngalinye livelisa iziyelelane nezithethe zalo.
Ulwimi lwesiXhosa luphawulwa yiphonology, imorphology, kunye nesintaksi esintsonkothileyo, ulwimi lwesiXhosa luqhayisa ngoonobumba abangamashumi amabini anesithandathu bealfabhethi yesiLatini, nangona abanye bebizwa ngokwahlukileyo kwisiNgesi. Ngoonobumba abalishumi elinesibhozo kunye nezikhamiso ezilishumi, ezinokuba mfutshane okanye zibe nde, isiXhosa sihlelwa njengolwimi lwethoni. Oku kuthetha ukuba ukuphakama kwelizwi kunokuyitshintsha intsingiselo yegama. Ulwimi lwesiXhosa lubandakanya iithoni ezimbini eziphambili: eziphezulu nezisezantsi.
Uphawu olwahlula ulwimi lwesiXhosa kukusetyenziswa kwezandi zokucofa, ezenziwe ngokufunxa ngaphakathi emlonyeni. Amazinyo, i-alveolar, kunye nokucofa okusecaleni kwenza ezi ndidi zintathu zokucofa ngesiXhosa. Ukucofa amazinyo kwenzeka xa incam yolwimi ibekwe emva kwamazinyo angaphezulu angaphambili kwaye ikhululwe ngesandi sokufunxa. Ukucofa i-alveolar kwenzeka xa incam yolwimi ihleli kwi-alveolar ridge, emva nje kwamazinyo aphezulu angaphambili, kwaye ikhutshwe ngesandi esiphumayo. Okokugqibela, ukucofa okusecaleni kwenzeka xa amacala olwimi ephumla kwimolars kwaye akhululwe ngesandi esibethayo. Olu nqakrazo lunokuguqulwa ngokudibanisa ezinye iiconsonants okanye izikhamiso phambi okanye emva kwazo.
Imo yokudityaniswa kwemo yesiXhosa, apho amagama abunjwa ngokufakela izimaphambili nezimamva kwiingcambu, lolunye uphawu oluphawulekayo. Olu lwimi luqulathe iindidi zezibizo ezilishumi elinesihlanu, eziphawulwe ngezimaphambili ezibonisa inani, isini, kunye nodidi lwesibizo. Ngokomzekelo, isimaphambili esithi "um-" sibonisa isibizo sesinye seklasi enye, ngokuqhelekileyo enxulumene nabantu okanye izilwanyana, ngelixa isimaphambili esithi "aba-" simele isininzi sesibizo sodidi lwesibini, olukwicandelo elifanayo nelodidi lokuqala. Ngaphaya koko, isiXhosa sinenkqubo yezenzi ezintsonkothileyo equka uluhlu lwemiba, imo, amaxesha kunye namazwi. Ngokudibanisa izimaphambili ezahlukahlukeneyo nezimamva kwisenzi esithi “ukubona” (ukubona), iintsingiselo ezahlukahlukeneyo zinokuvakaliswa, ezinjengokuthi “ndiyakubona” (ndikubona), “andiyikubona” (andikuboni), “ndiyakubona” (I see you) show you), "ndiyakubona" (ndibonwa nguwe), njalo njalo.
Ngokudibanisa izimaphambili ezahlukahlukeneyo nezimamva kwisenzi esithi “ukubona” (ukubona), iintsingiselo ezahlukahlukeneyo zinokuvakaliswa, ezinjengokuthi “ndiyakubona” (ndikubona), “andiyikubona” (andikuboni), “ndiyakubona” (I see you) show you), "ndiyakubona" (ndibonwa nguwe), njalo njalo.
Ulwimi lwesiXhosa lunempembelelo kwimbali, inkcubeko, noluntu lwalo. Ngenxa yorhwebo, ubukoloniyali, ukufuduka, kunye nokudityaniswa kwehlabathi, iye yaboleka amagama kwiilwimi ezahlukeneyo, eziquka isiNgesi, isiBhulu, isiDatshi, isiPhuthukezi, isiArabhu, nesiHindi.
IsiXhosa sikwabonakalisa iinqobo ezisemgangathweni, iinkolelo, nezithethe zamaXhosa, abaziva bengoobani na. Olu lwimi lusetyenziswa ukubonisa intlonipho, isidima, nobunye phakathi kwamaXhosa, kwanokunxibelelana nezinyanya kwakunye noThixo wawo. Ngaphezu koko, isiXhosa sidlala indima enkulu ekuyileni nasekugcineni uncwadi oluthethwayo lwesiXhosa olufana namaqhalo, izaci, amagama eendumiso, imibongo, iingoma, amabali neentsomi.
Kuluntu lwaseMzantsi Afrika lwangoku, ulwimi lwesiXhosa luthe gqolo ukubambezeleka kwaye lunempembelelo, lunegalelo kwiyantlukwano, umanyano nophuhliso lwesizwe. IsiXhosa esithathwa njengolunye lweelwimi ezilishumi elinanye ezisemthethweni kuMgaqo-siseko woMzantsi Afrika, sisetyenziswa kwiinkalo ngeenkalo, kuquka nezemfundo, iindaba, ezopolitiko, ezoshishino, nezobugcisa. Ifundiswa njengesifundo kwizikolo ezininzi kwaye ixhaswa yimibutho namaziko amaninzi.
Ulwimi lwesiXhosa lufaka ukuzingca nokomelela kumaXhosa kwaye lusebenza njengomthombo wenkuthazo nokufunda kwabanye.
Njengolwimi oluphilayo noluguquguqukayo, isiXhosa siyaziqhelanisa kwaye siguquke kunye namaxesha aguqukayo ngaphandle kokubeka esichengeni iimpawu nemisebenzi yaso engundoqo. Ibhiyozela kwaye iphakamise iyantlukwano ngelixa ikhulisa umanyano.
6.2. Iinkolelo zemveli kunye nezomoya.
“UQamata” sisithixo samaXhosa okanye isithixo esongamileyo, ngelixa elithi “Thixo” libhekisa kuThixo ngokweenkolelo zobuKristu, ekusenokwenzeka ukuba zaziswa ngabavangeli.
Igama elithi "Qamata" linxulunyaniswa kakhulu nenkolo yakwaXhosa kwaye elithi "Thixo" ligama elisetyenziswa kakhulu kuThixo kuLwimi lwesiXhosa. UQamata ubonwa njengamandla ahlala kwindawo zonke, anobubele nakhohlakeleyo, alawula ihlabathi kwaye aphembelele ikamva lomntu ngamnye. Eyona nto ibalulekileyo kubumoya bamaXhosa kukuhlonelwa kwezinyanya.
Izinyanya kukholelwa ukuba zingabalamli phakathi kwabaphilayo kunye noQamata, abanempembelelo ebonakalayo kwimicimbi yoluntu. AmaXhosa akholelwa ekubeni izinyanya zinawo amandla okusikelela okanye okuqalekisa inzala yawo, ngokuxhomekeke kwindlela aziphethe ngayo nokubambelela kwizithethe zakwaNtu. Kuthethwana nezinyanya yaye kuzukiswa ngezithethe, ngemithandazo nangeminikelo, njengoko zigqalwa njengabakhuseli nabanikezeli bokhokelo.
Nangona kunjalo, impembelelo yobuKrestu ibe nefuthe elikhulu kubumoya bamaXhosa. Ngokufika kwabemi baseYurophu nabavangeli basemazweni, inkolo yobuKrestu yaziswa kumaXhosa. Abantu abaninzi abangamaXhosa baye bayamkela inkolo yobuKrestu bayidibanisa nezithethe zabo.
Namhlanje, uninzi lwabantu abangamaXhosa bazichaza njengamaKristu ngeli lixa bezama ukugcina unxibelelwano neenkolelo zookhokho babo. Ifuthe lenkolo yobuKrestu kumoya wamaXhosa khange libekho ngaphandle koxinzelelo. Abantu bemveli, njengam, bakholelwa ukuba ubuKristu buye bazenza buthathaka iinkolelo zabo kwaye bujongela phantsi eyona nto bayiyo ngokomoya.
Nangona kwenziwe iinzame zokuhlanganisa inkolo yesiXhosa nenkolo yobuKrestu, inyaniso yeyokuba ezi zinto zimbini azihambelani. UbuKrestu kunye neenkolo zemveli zamaXhosa zihlala zingqubana ngenxa yeembono zabo ezahlukeneyo ngegunya kunye nonxibelelwano lwasemoyeni. Inkolo yobuKrestu igxile kwigunya likaYesu lokunxulumana noThixo, ngelixa isiko lamaXhosa ligxininisa ukunxibelelana noQamata ngosapho kunye nezinyanya. Ezi mbono zichaseneyo zidala ukruthakruthwano phakathi kweenkolo ezimbini, nto leyo ekhokelela kungquzulwano phakathi kwamaXhosa.
Abavangeli basemazweni bafuna ukuguqula amaXhosa elukholweni lwawo, nto leyo ethe yaphazamisa izithethe neenkolelo ezendele nzulu zenkcubeko yakwaXhosa. Ungquzulwano phakathi kwenkolo yobuKrestu neenkolo zemveli zamaXhosa kuphakamisa imibuzo malunga nokugcinwa kwenkcubeko kunye nelungelo lokwenza izinto zokomoya. Olu ngquzulwano luqhubekayo lubonisa umzabalazo obanzi phakathi kweengcamango zaseNtshona kunye neenkcubeko zemveli, njengoko ubuKristu bumele inkolo ekhonyayo, yasemzini, ngelixa isithethe samaXhosa sibonakalisa ilifa lenkcubeko yabantu. Ukwanda kwabaprofeti bobuxoki kwaneecawe zabo eMpuma Koloni kuthabathe ithuba lokuhlwempuzeka nokuphelelwa lithemba kwabantu, besebenzisa ubuthathaka babo ukuze bafumane inzuzo.
Aba bafane babizwe ngokuba ngabaprofeti badla ngokukhohlisa abalandeli ukuba banikele ngeemali ezinkulu okanye ezinye izinto ezixabisekileyo ukuze bafumane izithembiso zobuxoki zobutyebi okanye zokuphilisa. Ngenxa yoko, abantu abaninzi kunye neentsapho zisele zixinezeleke ngakumbi ngokwemali emva kokukhohliswa ngobuqhetseba. Ubumoya bakwaXhosa yintambo entsonkothileyo edibanisa inkolelo kuQamata, ukuhlonelwa kwezinyanya, ngeli lixa izama ukukhangela impembelelo yenkolo.
AmaXhosa nawo anonxulumano olunzulu nendalo kunye nezinto. Bakholelwa kubukho bemimoya yezinyanya kwizinto zendalo ezifana nemilambo, iintaba nemithi. Ezi zinto zendalo zibhekwa njengezingcwele kwaye zihlala ziziza zezithethe kunye nemikhosi. Amaxhwele adlala indima ebalulekileyo kwintlalo kaXhosa. Banolwazi olukhethekileyo kunye nezakhono zokunxibelelana nemimoya, ukuxilonga izigulo kunye nokubonelela ngamayeza. AmaXhosa anokholo olukhulu kumandla okuphilisa ala maxhwele, ahlonitshwayo nahlonitshwa ngobulumko nobuchule bawo.
6.3. Izithethe zokudlula kunye nemisitho yokwaluka.
AmaXhosa anelifa lenkcubeko etyebileyo emiliselwe nzulu kwizithethe ezahlukeneyo. La masiko sele esenziwa kangangeenkulungwane kwaye asathe gqolo ukuba nentsingiselo enkulu kwintlalo yamaXhosa, ngokwembali nanamhlanje. Elinye lawona masiko aziwayo nelibalulekileyo lokudlula phakathi kwamaXhosa ngumsitho wokwaluka owaziwa ngokuba ngu "ulwaluko."
Eli siko liphawula inguquko yamakhwenkwe amancinane ebudodeni kwaye lithathwa njengelona nyathelo libalulekileyo kubomi bendoda yomXhosa. Ngexesha lolwaluko, amakhwenkwe njengakumakhwenkwe athathwa asiwe kwizikolo zokwaluka ezikwanti, apho athi aluke khona afundiswe ngenkcubeko, uxanduva, neemfanelo zawo njengamadoda kwintlalo yamaXhosa. Olunye uqheliselo olubalulekileyo lokuhamba kukuqala kwamantombazana, aziwa ngokuba yi "intonjane." I-Intonjane igxile ekufundiseni amantombazana ngobufazi, izithethe zemveli, kunye nezakhono eziyimfuneko kwiindima zabo njengabafazi noomama.
Imitshato ikwabalulekile kwinkcubeko yamaXhosa, nto leyo ebonisa inguquko ukusuka ekubeni ungatshatanga uye ekubeni mtshatwe. Intonjane lisiko lokudlula kumantombazana enziwa ngabanye bezizwe zoMzantsi Afrika eziquka isizwe samaXhosa. EsiXhoseni igama elithi “intombi” libhekisa kwintombazana lize elithi “njane” lichaze into encinci, nto leyo eguqulelwe ngokuthe ngqo yesi-Intonjane ibe yintombazana encinci. Sisenzo esibalulekileyo senkcubeko ephawula utshintsho ukusuka kwintombazana encinci, ukuya kwibhinqa eliselula elinokuthi litshate. Kulo msitho weNtonjane, le ntwazana iye yodwa kwaye ifundiswa izakhono, amasiko, noxanduva olwahlukeneyo olulindeleke kwintombi eselula kwinkcubeko yakwaXhosa. Injongo kukumlungiselela ukuba ngumntu omdala nokuqinisekisa ukuba uxhotyiswe ngolwazi oluyimfuneko ukuze akwazi ukuhambahamba ebomini.
Intonjane ibinexabiso elikhulu kumaXhosa, ingakumbi kumaxesha angaphambili, nanjengoko ibidlala indima ebalulekileyo ekukhuthazeni ubunye beentsapho nasekudaleni imeko yokukhulisa abantwana. Ukulandela u-Intonjane, amabhinqa aselula alungiselelwa ukutshata, nto leyo enciphisa kakhulu amathuba okuba babe nabantwana ngaphandle komtshato. I-Intonjane ayizange iphelele nje ekulungiseleleni ukutshata, kodwa ikwabethelele izithethe ezifana noxanduva, intlonipho nokuthembeka, zinto ezo ebezibalulekile ekugcineni ubudlelwane obunempilo phakathi kwaXhosa.
Ulwaluko nesithonjane ziphawula utshintsho oluya ebuntwini obukhulu kumakhwenkwe namantombazana, ngokulandelelana, ngelixa imitshato yesiNtu yamaXhosa ibhiyozela ukumanyana kwabantu ababini. Le mibhiyozo ibalulekileyo inceda ekugcineni kwaye ihlonitshwe ilifa lenkcubeko yamaXhosa, iqinisekisa ukuba amasiko nezithethe zawo zihlala zidlamkile kwaye zixatyiswa kweli hlabathi lanamhlanje.

6.4. UbuGcisa neMisebenzi yesiXhosa.
Ubugcisa nobuchwephesha besiXhosa kudala budlala indima ebalulekileyo kwinkcubeko yamaXhosa. La mabinzana obugcisa aquka uluhlu olubanzi lwezifundo, kuquka umsebenzi wamaso, ukubumba, ukukrola amaplanga, nokuluka. Amagcisa esiXhosa asebenzisa imibala eqaqambileyo, iipateni ezintsonkothileyo, kunye nomqondiso ukwenza iziqwengana ezikhethekileyo nezinentsingiselo. Ezi zidla ngokukhuthazwa yindalo, ubumoya, neenkolelo zemveli zamaXhosa, zifakela indalo yazo ngokubaluleka kwenkcubeko etyebileyo kunye nokuvakala kwembali.
Umsebenzi wamaso kwinkcubeko yamaXhosa uphawuleka ngokukodwa, kuba amaso asetyenziswa ukubonisa iinkalo ezibalulekileyo zobomi ezifana newonga, ubudala, kunye newonga lomtshato. Umbala ngamnye wamaso kunye nepateni inokubaluleka kwawo, nto leyo eyenza ukuba isiqwenga ngasinye seso sisebenze ibali elibonakalayo lebali lomntu ngamnye. Iipateni ezintsonkothileyo nobuchwephesha bokuchwetheza besiXhosa bubonakalisa intlonipho enzulu yesithethe noluntu olusembindini wenkcubeko yamaXhosa.
Iingqayi kunye nokwaluka zikwayindlela ebalulekileyo yokubonakalisa ubugcisa kwinkcubeko yamaXhosa, ngeengqayi zomdongwe kunye neengobozi ezilukiweyo ezibonisa ubugcisa bobugcisa bamaXhosa. Udongwe, oluhlala luhonjiswe ngeepatheni neesimboli ezintsonkothileyo, lusebenza njengezinto ezisebenzayo zemihla ngemihla kunye nomsebenzi wobugcisa ogcina inkcubeko yenkcubeko yamaXhosa.
Ukwaluka, kwelinye icala, kubandakanya ukudityaniswa kwamalungu endalo ukwenza iingobozi ezintle ezisetyenziselwa ukugcinwa, iinjongo zemibhiyozo, okanye njengeziqwenga zokuhombisa. Kuncwadi, iimbongi zesiXhosa zidlale indima enkulu ekugcineni nokukhuthaza ulwimi lwesiXhosa nezithethe zomlomo.
Iimbongi zesiXhosa eziziwayo ziquka uS.E.K. UMqhayi noNontsizi Mgqwetho, abamisebenzi yabo ibe nefuthe kwizizukulwana zeembongi nababhali, kweli nakwihlabathi jikelele. Abalingisi besiXhosa nabo baphumelele kwishishini lemiboniso bhanyabhanya nakwimidlalo yeqonga. Iitalente ezinjengoJohn Kani, Nomsa Nene, noNomhle Nkonyeni ziye zatsala ababukeli ngemidlalo ebalaseleyo, bebeka amabali esiXhosa phambili kwaye beqhekeza imiqobo kwezolonwabo. Okokugqibela, abaqambi besiXhosa babe negalelo ekuphuhliseni umculo wamandulo eMzantsi Afrika. Umqambi womhobe wesizwe waseMzantsi Afrika, "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika," naye ufake igalelo kubutyebi bomculo wamaXhosa.
Ukuqamba kwakhe okungaphelelwa lixesha kuhlala kuluphawu olunamandla lomanyano kunye nenkululeko, enxibelelana nabantu kwihlabathi liphela. Omnye umba obalulekileyo kwinkcubeko yamaXhosa kukubhiyozelwa kweziganeko ezibalulekileyo kunye neziganeko zenkcubeko. Le mibhiyozo ayiqinisekisi nje kuphela ilifa lenkcubeko yamaXhosa koko ikwasebenza njengamathuba abalulekileyo omanyano loluntu nokugqithiswa kwezithethe ukusuka kwesinye isizukulwana ukuya kwesinye.

6.5. Ukutya kwesiXhosa kunye noKutya kwesintu.
“AmaKaffir ngabantu bezolimo nakwabelusi. Balima umhlaba ngomlinganiselo omkhulu, baze batsale inxalenye enkulu yokutya kwabo kuwo. Uhlobo lwe millet, ebizwa ngokuba ngamakholoni iKaffir corn, yayiziinkozo ezazilinywa ngabo kuphela ngaphambi kokufika kwamaYurophu.
Kule nto baphakamisa izixa ezikhulu, abazisebenzisayo nokuba zibilisiwe, okanye zityunyuzwe zibe yintlama eyenziwe ngayo isonka.
Babeqhelene nobugcisa bokubilisa nokwenza uhlobo oluthile lwebhiya, ababethanda ukuyisela, nto leyo eyabangela ukuba banxiliswe ngokukhawuleza. Kolu nkozo babelumkile ngalo lonke ixesha ukugcina isitokhwe esilungileyo esandleni.
Zazikhusela ekuhlaselweni kolu vukuvuku ngokulugcina kwimingxunya engangeni moya eyembiwe phantsi kweentlanti zeenkomo. Kwakhona babenamathanga, uhlobo lwethanga, ingcongolo enento eninzi yesaccharine, kunye nohlobo oluthile lwendongomane. Eminye imveliso yezitiya zabo, njengoko siyibona ngoku, yaqaliswa ukusukela oko baqhelana nomlungu.
Kwezo zikhankanyiweyo kukutya kwabo, kunye nokongezwa kobisi olugobileyo kunye nenyama ngamanye amaxesha. Batya kabini ngemini, isidlo sakusasa esincinane kusasa, kunye nesidlo esikhulu sokutshona kwelanga. Amakhwenkwe aselula avumelekile ukuba acathise naluphi na uhlobo lwenyama, kwanaleyo yeekati zasendle nezinye izilwanyana ezidla inyama, kodwa xa efikelela kwiminyaka yokuqola inyama yazo zonke izilwanyana ezingacocekanga iyalahlwa zizo.
Abasebenzisi naluphi na uhlobo lweentlanzi njengenqaku le-clict, kwaye bazibiza zonke iinyoka, ngaphandle kokwahlula."

Kaffir (Xhosa) Folk-Lore, nguGeorge McCall Theal.


Inkcubeko yamaXhosa etyebileyo neyantlukwano inabela ngaphaya kwembali nezithethe zawo ezinomtsalane, equka ilifa elidlamkileyo lokupheka elibonisa ukunxulumana okunzulu emhlabeni kunye nezinyanya zabo. AmaXhosa, ayinxalenye ebalulekileyo yenkcubeko yaseMzantsi Afrika, aphuhlise ukutya okukhethekileyo okuhlanganisa iimpembelelo ezisuka kwimvelaphi yabo yobuBantu, ukusebenzisana namaKhoisan, kunye neeyantlukwano ezicacileyo zengingqi ezavela emva kokwahlukana kwabo namaZulu.
Ukutya kwesiXhosa kuphawulwa kugxininiso lwezithako ezitsha, ezifumaneka ekuhlaleni ezifumaneka kwingingqi yeMpuma Koloni, apho uninzi lwamaXhosa luhlala khona. Imihlaba echumileyo inentaphane yeziqhamo, imifuno, ukutya okuziinkozo nemfuyo, nto leyo esisiseko sokutya kwabo kwesintu.
Esinye sezona zidlo zesiXhosa ngumngqusho, isidlo esinesondlo nesinesondlo esenziwe ngeenkozo zombona ezomisiweyo neembotyi zeswekile. Esi sidlo sinophawu olubalulekileyo lwenkcubeko njengoko besikade sigqalwa njengesidlo esimnandi ebekelwe iminyhadala ekhethekileyo kunye neminyhadala. Esona sidlo senziwe kuphela ngeenkozo zombona ezomisiweyo kunye neembotyi zeswekile kunye nesinongo kunye namafutha etase. Ukwahluka kwesi sidlo kubandakanya ukongezwa kwemifuno kunye nenyama ye-stew enomdla. Namhlanje, umngqusho usekukutya okuthandwayo okuthuthuzelayo okuzisa iintsapho kunye noluntu kunye.
Esinye isidlo esithandwayo ngumxhaxha, isidudu esimuncu esenziwe ngamazimba okanye umbona onegwele. Esi sidlo esimnandi nesihlaziyayo sihlala sibonwa njengesidlo sakusasa, sinika ukutya kunye namandla osuku oluzayo. Andikhumbuli ndisitya umxhaxha kodwa ndiye ndanento endicinga ukuba yi "ting" yesiTswana yawo.
Isiko lamaXhosa liyixabisile kakhulu inyama, ingakumbi igusha, inyama yenkomo, inkukhu, ezingundoqo kumasiko awo okutya. Oku kwabonakala xa utata ka-Mila uPedi wayetyelele nomhlobo wasekhaya, KG kwiminyaka embalwa eyadlulayo.
Ekufikeni kwabo siphakathi komsitho wesiNtu, bathe xa besithelela, besesigqibile ukuxhela sabe sisoja okokuqala, nabo bangenelela, emva kweyure ezimbini kwafika enye inkonzo evela ngasebuhlanti. Siye saqhubeka satya inyama futhi, ngeli xesha silinde isidlo sasemini esikhulu. Kaloku kuthiwa Umfundisi ulindwa nge vesi. 
Ngosuku olulandelayo, bakhetha ipapa nemifuno, bengasayifuni inyama tu.
Inyama yebhokhwe ikwaxatyiswa kakhulu, isoloko isetyenziselwa amasiko nezithethe. Ndikhumbula ngokucacileyo ukuqala kwam ebudodeni, apho ndabandakanyeka kumdlalo wokujijisana ngeqhekeza elikhulu lenyama yebhokhwe ngexesha lesidlo somsitho.
“Ukoja,” igama lesiXhosa elithetha ibraai, limele indlela exatyiswe kakhulu yokulungisa inyama nebambe indawo ekhethekileyo entliziyweni yam, ivuselela iinkumbulo notata. Uhambo lwethu oluya edolophini lwalusoloko lulindelwe ngolangazelelo, ubukhulu becala kuba ndandisazi ukuba siza kubraai emva kokugqiba umsebenzi wethu. Ngenxa yokuba uninzi lokutya kwethu ekhaya kwakuphekelwa ngaphakathi, ibraai yaba sisihlandlo esikhethekileyo. Ibraaing for the family kwilali yethu ezilalini kwakudla ngokutolikwa njengesimemo soluntu njengoko, ngomoya wokuba ngummelwane, babecinga ukuba mhlawumbi senza umsitho wesintu okanye senze idini kwaye njengamalungu asekuhlaleni yayingumsebenzi wabo ukuza kunceda. 
Inyama yehagu ikwaxatyiswa kakhulu kwinkcubeko yethu, ixatyiswa ngenxa yencasa yayo etyebileyo kunye neempawu zayo ezanelisayo, isebenza njengendawo yokuzonwabisa eyamkelekileyo ezilalini apho inyama yayiyinto enqabileyo. Ukuziphatha okuqhelekileyo kweelali zethu, apho imibhiyozo yayibandakanya uluntu lonke, yayidla ngokunika ukutya okunesondlo, umthombo obalulekileyo wesondlo kwiimeko ezinzima. Intloko yehagu sisidlo esithandwayo ekhayeni lam, sisonwatyelwa lilungu ngalinye lentsapho, kuquka abanemilenze emine. Ngelixesha singcamla inyama enencasa, iSkhokho nePeanut zonwabele ukugragrama amathambo amnandi iintsuku zilandelelana.
Ezinye izitya zesiXhosa eziphawulekayo ziquka;
Umcuku
Isophu
Iphukutsha
Umqa
Qumatana
Umkhupha
Ulusu
Ukongeza kwezi zitya zemveli, ukutya kwesiXhosa kukwaquka uluhlu olubanzi lokutya kwasendle okuxheshwayo kwindawo ejikelezileyo. Oku kuquka isipinatshi sasendle kunye nezinye iziqhamo nemifuno, ezongeza incasa nencasa ekhethekileyo ekutyeni kwazo. Unxulumano olusondeleyo lwamaXhosa kwindalo lubonakala kwiindlela zabo zokupheka, njengoko besamkela imithombo yokutya ezinzileyo nengenabungozi kokusingqongileyo.
Kubantu bamaXhosa nabemi boMzantsi Afrika, ukuphonononga ubucukubhede bokutya kwesiXhosa ayilohambo lokutya kuphela kodwa yindlela yokunxibelelana neengcambu zookhokho babo. Ngokungcungcuthekisa amavumba okutya kwaXhosa, umntu unokufumana ulwazi olunzulu ngembali, inkcubeko, nokomelela kwamaXhosa.
Isahluko seSixhenxe: Uqhagamshelwano, ungquzulwano nentsebenziswano nemikhosi yamaKoloniyali.

7.1. Ukudibana kwangaphambili nabahloli baseYurophu.
Ukudibana kwantlandlolo phakathi kwamaXhosa nabakhenkethi baseYurophu kuphawula inguqu ebalulekileyo kwimbali yesizwe samaXhosa. Ezi ndibano, ezathi zenzeka ekupheleni kwenkulungwane yeshumi elinesihlanu nasekuqaleni kwenkulungwane yeshumi elinesithandathu, zaziya kuhlala zibumba ikamva lamaXhosa njengoko ayejongana nemingeni namathuba aziswa kukufika kwabemi baseYurophu elunxwemeni lwabo.
Kwaba ngeli xesha lokufuduka kunye nokudityaniswa apho abahloli bamazwe baseYurophu, beqhutywa ngumnqweno weendlela ezintsha zokurhweba kunye nemithombo yobutyebi, baqala ukungena kwimimandla esemazantsi eAfrika. Ukufika kwaba bahloli bamazwe abafana noBartholomeu Dias noVasco da Gama kwazisa uthotho lweenguqulelo eziphawulekayo kumaXhosa.
Ekuqaleni, ukudibana phakathi kwamaXhosa nabeLungu kwakuphawulwa kukufuna ukwazi kunye nokuphonononga ngononophelo.
Omabini la macala ayechukumisekile kukwahluka kwezithethe, ulwimi nobugcisa. KumaXhosa, ukufika kwaba bantu basemzini kwavula amathuba amatsha okurhweba kwaye babazisa ngezinto ezintsha kunye nobuchwepheshe.
Nangona kunjalo, njengoko ubukoloniyali kunye nokuhlaliswa kwabantu baseYurophu kwakusanda kulo mmandla, kwaqala ukuxabana. AmaXhosa, awayenembali ende yokuzilawula nokuzimela, azibone sele ejongene nokugxuphuleka kwamazwe aseYurophu kwimihlaba yawo. Oku kwakhokelela kuthotho lweemfazwe, ezaziwa ngokuba ziimfazwe zamaXhosa, njengoko amaXhosa ayechasa ngokukrakra ulawulo lwaseYurophu.
7.2. Iimfazwe zembali yamaXhosa kunye nemibutho yokuchasa.
Iimfazwe zamaXhosa, ezidla ngokubizwa ngokuba ziiFrontier Wars, yayiluthotho lweemfazwe phakathi kwamaqela amaXhosa kunye nemikhosi yamakoloniyali angamaNgesi. Ezi mfazwe zathatha amashumi aliqela eminyaka, ukusuka ekuqaleni kwenkulungwane yeshumi elinesibhozo ukuya phakathi kwinkulungwane yeshumi elinesithoba, kwaye zaziphawulwa yiwebhu entsonkothileyo yezopolitiko, ezoqoqosho kunye nezenkcubeko. Nantsi isishwankathelo seemfazwe, oonobangela bazo kunye neziphumo.
Imfazwe yokuQala (1779-1781) yaqala xa amaBhulu emida athimba iinkomo zamaXhosa. Imfazwe yaphela sele iphelile, kungekho mntu uphumeleleyo. Ifuthe kumaXhosa

Umphumo waba kukuba iBhritane yabhangisa iKoloni yaseBritane yaseKaffraria yaza yayifaka kwiKoloni yaseKapa.
7.3. Iziganeko zembali zentsebenziswano phakathi kwamaXhosa, amaBritane namaBhulu.
Nangona kukho ungquzulwano phakathi kwamaXhosa, amaBritane namaBhulu, intsebenziswano phakathi kwawo yayingaqhelekanga. Isidingo sabo sokusebenzisana ngenxa yezizathu zoqoqosho okanye zokhuseleko kudla ngokukhokelela kwizivumelwano ezingalindelekanga kunye nentsebenziswano kulo mmandla. La malungiselelo aqhutywa yipragmatism endaweni yokuthembana kokwenene, okukhokelela kubudlelwane obunzima kwaye ngamanye amaxesha obunzima phakathi kwamaqela abandakanyekayo.
Ukhuphiswano oluthe gqolo lokulawula umhlaba nemithombo luphembelele ubume bolu manyano, lwakhokelela kulungelelwano olubuthathaka lwamagunya apho amathuba kunye nokuzingca kudlale indima ebalulekileyo. Le meko-bume eguqukayo yavelisa umanyano olumangalisayo kunyeukungcatshwa ngequbuliso, ukubumba indlela ejikeleze loo mmandla.
Iziganeko eziqaphelekayo zentsebenziswano ziquka amaXhosa enza umanyano namaNgesi ngokuchasene namaBhulu, emva koko atshintsha amacala ukuze afeze iimfuno zawo. Ukusukela amandla kunye nokuphila kumhlaba okhohlakeleyo kwaqhuba olu manyano lwamanzi, lubonisa ukuguquka okuguquguqukayo kwamandla kunye nobutyebi kummandla.
Kuyo yonke imbali, zininzi iziganeko zentsebenziswano phakathi kwamaXhosa namaNgesi namaBhulu. Ekuqaleni kweminyaka yoo-1700, iziduko ezithile zamaXhosa zazisebenza njengabalusi beenkomo kwiifama zabaphambukeli, zisenza umanyano olwahlukeneyo. Ngeminyaka yoo-1790, iinkosi zamaXhosa ezinempembelelo ezifana noNgqika noNdlambe zadibana namaNgesi ekulweni namaBhulu. Le ndlela yokusebenzisana yaqhubeka ukutyhubela inkulungwane ye-19, iinkosi zamaXhosa zamkela ukufika kwabavangeli basemazweni, zityikitya izivumelwano namaNgesi, zibambene neenkomfa zoxolo. zonke kusukelo lozinzo kunye nokukhusela iimfuno zabantu babo.
Ukongeza, bekukho ipateni engaguqukiyo yokutshintsha kwentembeko phakathi kwezizwe zomthonyama njengoko zijongana nemingeni yoloyiso lobukoloniyali. Umzekelo, amaZulu aqale awachasa omabini amaNgesi namaBhulu kodwa emva koko aseka intsebenziswano eethe-ethe namaNgesi phambi kokuba ajike ngokuchasene nawo kwiMfazwe yamaNgesi namaZulu ka-1879.
Oku kubonisa ubudlelwane obuntsonkothileyo nobobuchule izizwe zomthonyama ezathi zathi zaqulunqa ngamandla obukoloniyali ukuze ziphile kwaye zikhuseleke. Ukutshintsha kwentembeko kubonakalisa ubume obunobuninzi beempendulo zemveli kubukoloniyali kunye neentshukumo ezintsonkothileyo zezopolitiko zelo xesha.
7.4. Impembelelo yobuKoloniyali kuluntu lwamaXhosa.
Ukufika kwamakoloniyali aseYurophu eMzantsi Afrika kwaba nefuthe elikhulu kumaXhosa, nto leyo eyaguqula intlalo, inkcubeko, uqoqosho nezopolitiko. AmaXhosa, alanda imvelaphi yawo yembali esuka kuMbindi Afrika njenge Bantu, sele edibene notshintshiselwano olubalulekileyo lwenkcubeko nama Khoisan phambi kokufika kwamaYurophu. Ubukoloniyali beza notshintsho olutsha oluza kubumba intlalo kaXhosa kwizizukulwana ngezizukulwana.
Enye yezona mpembelelo zibalulekileyo zenkqubo yobukoloniyali kukuphazamiseka kweenkqubo zolawulo lwakwaXhosa. Amagunya aseYurophu ayefuna ukulawula abemi bomthonyama, esoloko enyanzelisa iziseko zolawulo lwawo yaye ejongela phantsi igunya leenkosi zamaXhosa. Oku kukhokelele kungquzulwano phakathi kwesizwe samaXhosa kunye nokudilizwa kwezakhiwo zamagunya emveli.

Ubukholoniyali nabo bazisa inkolo yobuKrestu kumaXhosa. Abathunywa bevangeli bafika ngeenjongo zokuguqula isiXhosa kwinkolo yobuKrestu, nto leyo eyakhokelela kwiinzame zokudibanisa iinkolelo zemveli nezobuKrestu.
Ngokwezoqoqosho, ubukoloniyali baba nefuthe elibi kumaXhosa. Abaphambukeli baseYurophu bahluthe imihlaba emikhulu, bashiya uninzi lwamaXhosa kwaye baphazamisa nenkcubeko yabo yezolimo. Le lahleko yomhlaba nobutyebi yakhokelela kubunzima bezoqoqosho kunye nokukhukuliseka kwentlalo yemveli yamaXhosa.
Ifuthe lobukoloniyali liye lanwenwela nakulwimi nakwimfundo. Amagunya aseYurophu anyanzelise iilwimi zawo, ezifana nesiNgesi nesiBhulu, njengezona lwimi ziphambili kunxibelelwano nemfundo. Ngenxa yoko, amasiko nezithethe zolwimi lwesiXhosa ziye zajongana nokujongelwa phantsi, nto leyo ebeka isoyikiso ekugcinweni kobuXhosa kunye nelifa lemveli.
Ubukoloniyali bube nefuthe elikhulu nelingapheliyo kwintlalo yamaXhosa. Iziphazamiso ezibangelwe ngamathanga aseYurophu zakhokelela kutshintsho kulawulo, unqulo, ezoqoqosho, ulwimi nemfundo. Ukuqonda ifuthe lobukoloniyali kumaXhosa kubaluleke kakhulu ekuqondeni iingcamba ezintsonkothileyo zembali yawo, kwakunye nokuxabisa ukomelela nokomelela kwenkcubeko yamaXhosa xa ejongene nobunzima.


Isahluko sesibhozo: UbuNtu neNkcubeko yamaXhosa kuMzantsi Afrika wale mihla.

Isahluko sesibhozo, imingeni kunye namathuba kuluntu oluguqukayo.
AmaXhosa aye ajongana nemiqobo emininzi kwimbali yawo, equka ukwahlulwa kwamaZulu, ukudibana namaKhoikhoi, ubukoloniyali, isiprofeto sikaNongqawuse, ukushenxiswa ngenkani, kunye nemigaqo-nkqubo yengcinezelo. Le mingeni ivavanye ukomelela nokomelela kwesizwe samaXhosa, kodwa ikwabonelele ngamathuba okukhula nokuxhathisa.
AmaXhosa, njengabanye abemi boMzantsi Afrika, achaphazeleke kakhulu yintlupheko ukusukela oko i-African National Congress yathatha izintambo zokulawula. Iphondo leMpuma Koloni, nelona linabemi abaninzi abangamaXhosa, lithwaxwa ziingxaki kwiindawo ezininzi. Iyaxaka into yokuba iphondo leMpuma Koloni lelinye lamaziko eANC, elihlala liphakathi kwamaphondo aphezulu ngokwenkxaso yabavoti kulo mbutho. . Intswela-ngqesho kweli phondo iphezulu kakhulu kumyinge wama-42% xa kuthelekiswa nelizwe liphela, nto leyo eyenza ibe lelona phondo liphezulu kuwo onke amaphondo, ngaphandle kokuba ubani uqwalasela inkcazo eyandisiweyo yentswela-ngqesho, ethe, ngeli lixa iphezulu kuma-47%, ingeyiyo eyona nto imbi elizweni. .
Oku kuye kwawenza mandundu amaqondo entlupheko kumaXhosa, nto leyo ebangela ukuba kube nzima nangakumbi ukuba ahlukane nentlupheko aphucule ubomi bawo.
Inkqubo yemfundo esesikweni kwiPhondo leMpuma Koloni nayo ayiphumelelanga, inamazinga aphantsi okufunda nokubhala kunye nezixhobo zokufundisa ezingonelanga ezikolweni. Kungoko abantwana abaninzi bamaXhosa bengafumani mfundo isemgangathweni, nto leyo ibambezela amathuba abo okuphumelela kwixesha elizayo. Ngokwezalathi ezingundoqo zentlalo noqoqosho ezifana namanqanaba engeniso, ukufikelela kwiinkonzo ezisisiseko, kunye nokubonelela ngokhathalelo lwempilo, iMpuma Koloni iphakathi kwezona ziphantsi elizweni.
Okothusayo kukuba, iinkcukacha-manani zolwaphulo-mthetho kwiPhondo leMpuma Koloni, ngakumbi ngo-2023, zidiza ukwanda okumandla kolwaphulo-mthetho olunobundlobongela obufana nokubulala nokukhuthuza. Izinga lokubulawa kweli phondo ngoku liphantse liphindeke kabini kunomndilili wesizwe, nto leyo eyenza libe lelinye lawona aphezulu elizweni.
Iyaxaka into yokuba ukusukela ngo1994, iMpuma Koloni ibilelona lizwe libonelela oomongameli belizwe, kuquka iinkokeli ezaziwayo ezifana noNelson Mandela noThabo Mbeki. Ngelixa la manani enconywa kwihlabathi jikelele ngesakhono sawo sobunkokeli esibalaseleyo ngokufikelela kwesona sikhundla siphezulu sezopolitiko, iyaxaka into yokuba iimeko zokuhlala kumaphondo awo azibonanga mpucuko zibonakalayo, kwaye endaweni yoko zihlala ziphakathi kwezona zinzima kwilizwe.
Umntu akanakuzibamba kodwa acinge ukuba bekuya kuba luncedo kangakanani na ukuba bebemisele umzekelo ngokufumana iziphumo eziphawulekayo kumaphondo abo asuka kuwo, kunokuba bathembele kuphela kwiintetho zabo ezicengayo ukuze bafumane izikhundla ezihloniphekileyo. Ezi nkcukacha-manani ziphakamisa inkxalabo emandla malunga nokusebenza ngempumelelo kobunkokheli ekushukuxeni imingeni yezentlalo noqoqosho elijongene nayo iPhondo leMpuma Koloni.
Nangona kukho iinkokeli ezineziqinisekiso ezincomekayo, kubonakala ngathi ifuthe lazo ekuphuculeni iimeko zokuhlala kwiphondo labo lilinganiselwe, nto leyo eshiya abahlali bezamana nolwaphulo-mthetho oluthe gqolo kunye nezalathisi ezingentle zentlalo noqoqosho. Umahluko phakathi kwempumelelo yezopolitiko kunye nokuphuculwa okubambekayo phantsi kugxininisa ukuntsonkotha kolawulo kunye nemfuno engxamisekileyo yezisombululo ezibanzi.
Nangona kukho impumelelo engentle, efana nokufakelwa kombane emaphandleni, impumelelo yangaphambili ye-African National Congress kwiPhondo leMpuma Koloni igutyungelwe lifuthe elibi lombane ongathembekanga noneendleko eziphezulu, ingakumbi kuninzi lwabantu abangathathi ntweni. Oku kudale umjikelo wentlupheko kwaye kuthintele ukukhula koqoqosho, kunyanzelise uluntu oluninzi ukuba luxhomekeke kwezinye izinto ezixabisa kakhulu njengeparafini neenkuni ekuphekeni nasekufudumezeni.
Ngenxa yoko, umthwalo uwela ngokungathandekiyo kwabo bangakwaziyo ukuwufikelela, nto leyo eqhubela phambili umjikelo wokungalingani kwezoqoqosho. Ngokubanzi, umzabalazo wamaXhosa uvakala kuninzi lwabemi boMzantsi Afrika njengoko ilizwe lithe gqolo ukuhlehla. Ukufuduka okuthe gqolo kwabantu abatsha besuka kweli phondo befuna amathuba angcono yindlela ehlala ihleli, ngaphandle koqinisekiso lwangaphambili lophuhliso lwasemaphandleni oluye lwaxhaswa ngamaphulo axabisa kakhulu axhaswa ngabahlawuli-rhafu athe ekugqibeleni avelisa iziphumo ezincinci.
Namhlanje, amaXhosa azibona ekwintlalo eguquka ngokukhawuleza. Ukudityaniswa kwehlabathi, ukufudukela kwabantu ezidolophini, kunye nokuphucula imeko yangoku kuzise amathuba amatsha okuqhubela phambili kwezoqoqosho nokutshintshiselana ngenkcubeko. Nangona kunjalo, olu tshintsho lukwadala imingeni ekugcinweni kwezithethe zamaXhosa kunye nokumanyana kweendawo abahlala kuzo.
8.1. Iinzame zokuvuselela nokulondolozwa kwenkcubeko yamaXhosa.
Kwimbali etyebileyo yembali yoMzantsi Afrika, amaXhosa athe avela njengeqela elidumileyo nelinempembelelo. Uhambo lwabo olusuka kumbindi weAfrika njengabaphambukeli baBantu ukuya kunxibelelwano lwabo namaKhoisan kwaye ekugqibeleni bahlukana kumaZulu kuye kwabumba ubuni babo obukhethekileyo. Namhlanje, iinzame zokuvuselela nokugcina inkcubeko yamaXhosa ziqhutywa ngabantu nemibutho enenzondelelo.
AmaXhosa anebhongo alanda umnombo wawo emva kookhokho bawo abangaBantu, abasuka kuMbindi Afrika kumakhulu eminyaka. Le mfuduko yabenza badibana nabantu abangama Khoisan, nto leyo eyakhokelela ekudityanisweni kweendlela zenkcubeko kunye nezithethe. Ukudityaniswa kwala maqela mabini ahlukeneyo kwadala uluntu oludlamkileyo nolwahlukeneyo.
Kwiminyaka yakutshanje, kuphinde kwagxilwa ngokutsha ekuvuseleleni nasekugcinweni kwenkcubeko yamaXhosa. Olu phando luye lwanceda ekuhlanganiseni iphazili yembali yamaXhosa, inika iimbono ezixabisekileyo ngemvelaphi nendaleko yazo.
Kutshanje ndifumene ubutyebi bamaxwebhu embali kwiVan Warmelo Collection, enokufumaneka simahla kwiwebhusayithi yeYunivesithi yasePitoli. Kwisithuba seminyaka engama-30 ukuya kuma-40, uGqr Van Warmelo, i-Ethnologist kaRhulumente kwiSebe leMicimbi yeBantu, uye wawaqokelela la maxwebhu ngononophelo nangononophelo. Ekuswelekeni kwakhe, ezi zanikelwa eyunivesithi. Le ngqokelela iqulethe imibhalo yantlandlolo echaza iinkalo ezahlukeneyo zembali, izithethe, nezithethe zabantu bomthonyama bendawo ngoku ebizwa ngokuba nguMzantsi Afrika. Abapapashi beLifa leMveli baseMzantsi Afrika baye babhala amaxwebhu embali ukuze bafikeleleke lula kwaye banikezela ngobulungu ngaphantsi kwama-R400 ngonyaka.
KumaXhosa, ezi nzame zolondolozo ziye zaba liqhayiya kunye nokuxhobisa. Ngokwamkela ilifa lenkcubeko yabo, babuyisela ubuni babo kwihlabathi lanamhlanje. Iinkqubo zokuvuselelwa kolwimi, umculo wesintu nemijuxuzo yesintu, nemibhiyozo yoluntu zonke zibe zizixhobo zokugcina nokukhuthaza inkcubeko yesiXhosa.
Imvuselelo yoncwadi lwesiXhosa ngumbutho ofuna ukuvuselela nokutyebisa uncwadi lwesiXhosa, oluthethwayo nolubhaliweyo, ngokuvelisa nokupapasha imisebenzi emitsha, kwanokuvuselela nokugcina imisebenzi emidala. Imvuselelo yoncwadi lwesiXhosa ikhokelwa ngababhali besiXhosa beli xesha abafana noMphuthumi Ntabeni, abaphonononga imbali nenkcubeko yamaXhosa nzulu kwiinoveli, imibongo nezincoko zabo.
Uhambo lwembali lwamaXhosa ukusuka kuMbindi Afrika ukuya eMzantsi Afrika, ukusebenzisana kwabo namaKhoisan, nokwahlukana kwabo namaZulu kuye kwabumba ubuni babo obukhethekileyo. Iinzame zokuvuselela nokugcina inkcubeko yamaXhosa ziye zaqatsela kule minyaka idlulileyo, abathandi bembali, amaXhosa nabemi boMzantsi Afrika bonke bedlala indima enkulu. Ngokutyhila ubugocigoci bembali yamaXhosa nokuwola inkcubeko yawo, amaXhosa enza indlela eya kwikamva eliqaqambileyo nelixhotyisiweyo.
8.2. Impembelelo yonxibelelwano lwangoku, ukugcinwa kweerekhodi, kunye neenkqubo zikarhulumente kwimizamo yokuvuselela nokugcina.
Abantu abaninzi, ebomini babo nangomsebenzi wabo, basebenze nzima ukugcina nokubuyisela amasiko nezithethe zamaXhosa. Ngokuhambelana nesithethe sethu somlomo, ubuchule obungakhankanywanga, kunye nokufunda okungacwangciswanga, abantu ebebenza oku bakholisa ukubonwa kuphela ziintsapho zabo kunye noluntu olusondeleyo, njengabazali, ootatomkhulu, oomalume, oodadobawo, kunye nabanye ababambelela kwizithethe zakwaNtu. ezilalini zelizwe.
Intsebenziswano kunye nokuhlalisana phakathi kweAfrika kunye neNtshona kunye neMpuma kuye kwandise ukufikelela kwigalelo labo ngaphaya kwezangqa zabo ezisondeleyo. Enkosi kumajelo eendaba ezentlalo, iincwadi, kunye nezinye iindlela zonxibelelwano kunye nokugcinwa kweerekhodi, abantu kwihlabathi liphela banokufikelela kubuchwephesha bala magorha angekadunyiswa, kungakhathaliseki ukuba baqhagamshelwe njani kwi-intanethi okanye bafikelele kwimidiya.
Ayinakuphikiswa into yokuba amazwe aseNtshona adlale indima enkulu ekukhukulisekeni kancinci kancinci kokubambelela kwamaXhosa kwizithethe nenkcubeko. Ezinye zezona zinto zibalulekileyo zibandakanya ukunyanzeliswa kwemithetho yaseNtshona, ukujongelwa phantsi kwezenzo zesithethe ezingekho sikweni ngokufunda okusesikweni, nokoyisa emkhosini.
Kuyamangalisa ngokwenene ukuba okuchaseneyo kuyinyaniso, kwaye mhlawumbi nangaphezulu, kuba ngoku sinamaziko emfundo angaqeqesheli kuphela kwaye aqinisekise abantu ngabanye, kodwa abonelele ngeqonga lokubonisa ubuchule babo kunye nophando oluqhubekayo ngalo mbandela. Kuyaphawuleka ukuba uninzi lwemithombo endiyisebenzisileyo kuphando lwam nasekubhaleni yayingesiNgesi, endathi ndakwazi ukufikelela kuzo ngenxa yobugcisa obukhoyo kum njengomAfrika waseMzantsi Afrika. Obu bugcisa, benziwa ikakhulu ngabantu abasuka ngaphandle kweAfrika, bundivumele ukuba ndikwazi ukufikelela kulwazi oluvela kwihlabathi liphela.
Ngenxa yoko, iinzame zokulondoloza ziye zafikeleleka ngakumbi kunanini na ngaphambili. Amaqumrhu karhulumente kweli xesha langoku aphumeze iindlela zenkxaso-mali ukuxhasa imibutho nabantu abazinikele ngokunzulu ekugcineni inkcubeko etyebileyo nedlamkileyo yamaXhosa. Ukongeza, uMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika uyakuqonda ukubaluleka kwamaXhosa, nto leyo ebonisa impembelelo ehlala ihleli yelifa lemveli laseNtshona enokuthi ilandele emva ekusekweni kweMelika nangaphaya, ukuya kutsho kwixesha lamaRoma.
UNjingalwazi Nokuzola Mndende, unjingalwazi obekekileyo kwisebe leSociology and Anthropology kwiDyunivesithi yaseNelson Mandela owagqiba iPhD yakhe ngo-2002. Ukusetyenziswa kobuchwepheshe bale mihla kuye kwaququzelela uthethathethwano phakathi kwabantu abanenjongo enye, naxa besondela kuyo ngeendlela ezahlukeneyo.
UDaluxo Hobo uye wazisa ulwazi oluchukumisayo malunga nezithethe nenkcubeko yesiXhosa, ngelixa ekwaphonononga ngokunzulu indlela unjingalwazi ukuphakamisa iimbono zakhe, ngakumbi ngokunxulumene neBhayibhile. UJongisilo Pokwana ka Menziwa, umtshana kaMndende ngokwesi sikhundla, ukwabhale icwecwe elinesihloko esithi “Mndende and her delusional anti-Mfenguism posture”. Ezi ngxoxo bezingenakufikeleleka kum kwi-ofisi yam yasekhaya eRhawutini ukuba bekungengenxa yetekhnoloji yanamhlanje enokuba yintsikelelo okanye isiqalekiso. Ndiwuqaqambisa lo mzekelo kuba ngoku ndixakene nentetho kwaye ngokukhutheleyo ndifuna amazwi ahlukeneyo ngokusebenzisa iindlela ezahlukeneyo zokwandisa ukuqonda kwam.
Ngelixa ndiqamba le ncwadi, ndijonge ngenkuthalo esona sigqibo sokugqibela songquzulwano. Nangona kunjalo, ndinombulelo ongazenzisiyo ngezixhobo ezixabisekileyo endinazo ezindivumela ukuba ndiphonononge ukuqala kongquzulwano, ukubuyela emva kunyaka ka-2017 nangaphaya, kangangoko ingxelo ebhaliweyo ivuma. Ngokusebenzisa ezi zixhobo, ndiyakwazi ukulandelela isisombululo esinokubakho songquzulwano kwixesha elizayo, ukuya kuthi ga kunyaka ka-2024 nangaphaya. Nangona ndingekafikeleli kwinqanaba lophando lwam apho ezi zinto zifunyanisiweyo zibonakala, izibonelelo zoncedo endinazo zinika ithuba elikhethekileyo lokuziqokelela ngokwam ulwazi lwexesha elidlulileyo, kunokuthembela kuphela kwiingxelo zomlomo ezidluliselwe ngabo bangaphambi kwam.

8.3. Ifuthe lesiXhosa kwiPolitiko, uBugcisa noNcwadi.
Kwezopolitiko, amaXhosa ebengabadlali abaphambili kwimbali yoMzantsi Afrika. Iinkokeli zabo, ezinjengoHintsa noSarhili, yayingabantu abanempembelelo ababedlala indima ebalulekileyo ekuchaseni ulawulo lwamakoloniyali nokumela amalungelo abantu babo.
Iimfazwe zamaXhosa, ezaliwa namaNgesi ngenkulungwane ye-19, zibubungqina bokuzimisela kwawo okungagungqiyo kunye nobuchule bobuchule bobuchule. Olu ngquzulwano lusekelwe kukhuseleko oluqatha lwamaXhosa umhlaba nobukhosi bawo, lushiye uphawu olungacimekiyo kwimbali yoMzantsi Afrika.

9.1. Ukhenketho lwenkcubeko nophuhliso loluntu.
Ukhenketho lwenkcubeko lunamandla ophuhliso loluntu, ingakumbi kuluntu lwemveli oluzama ukugcina ilifa labo elikhethekileyo kunye nokulandela amathuba oqoqosho. Oku kucace gca kwimeko yamaXhosa asuka eMzantsi Afrika, apho ukhenketho lwezenkcubeko lungakhange luqaqambise imbali yabo enzulu kuphela kodwa luqinise nendawo abahlala kuzo.
Olu hlobo lokhenketho luvumela amaXhosa ukuba abelane ngebali lawo elimangalisayo nehlabathi, nto leyo eyenza abakhenkethi kunye nabo bathanda imbali bangene nzulu kwiinkalo ngeenkalo zembali yamaXhosa, ukusuka ekufudukeni kwabo ukuya eMzantsi Afrika ukuya kukudibana kwabo namaKhoisan. Ukongeza, inika amaXhosa ithuba lokuphinda aqhagamshelane nemvelaphi yawo kwaye azidle ngemveli yawo ngokubonisa izithethe zawo, ulwimi, umculo, kunye nomdaniso, eqinisekisa ukugcinwa nokudluliselwa kwelifa lenkcubeko yawo kwizizukulwana ezizayo.
UMzantsi Afrika likhaya kwinginginya yeendawo ezinomtsalane ezibonisa inkcubeko etyebileyo kunye nembali yembali yamaXhosa, uhlanga oludumileyo kweli lizwe. Qalisa kuhambo lokufumana izinto njengoko uphonononga ezi ndawo zimangalisayo zelifa lesiXhosa:
ILali yeNkcubeko yaseCata: Dibana nobubele nobubele boluntu olumanyeneyo lwamaXhosa njengoko bevulela iindwendwe iingcango zabo. Zibandakanye kuhambo olukhanyiselayo lokuqonda inkcubeko yabo, imbali, kunye nemekobume ebalaseleyo ebangqongileyo.

9.2. Ukubhiyozela iminyhadala nemisitho yenkcubeko yesiXhosa.
Kwimbali edlamkileyo yembali yoMzantsi Afrika, amaXhosa aluke a
ibali elityebileyo nelinika umdla. Ukusukela kwimvelaphi yawo yamandulo kuMbindi we-Afrika njengabaphambukeli baBantu ukuya kuthi ga ekudibaneni kwabo namaKhoisan, amaXhosa ayoyise imicelimngeni emininzi kwaye avela njengeqela lenkcubeko elahlukileyo neliziqhenyayo.
Omnye weminyhadala ebalaseleyo kwinkcubeko yamaXhosa nguMthendeleko woKwaluka, nokwaziwa ngokuba ngu “Ukwaluka”. Esi sithethe singcwele siphawula inguqu yamakhwenkwe amaXhosa asakhulayo ebudodeni. Lixesha elibaluleke kakhulu kwaye libhiyozelwa ngezithethe kunye nemisitho. Ngesi siganeko, abakhwetha bathathwa basiwe kwindawo efihlakeleyo apho bayokwaluka khona bafundiswe iinqobo nezithethe zookhokho babo. Uluntu luphela luyadibana ukuze luxhase kwaye lubhiyozele abafana, lubonisa amandla nembumba yamaXhosa.
Omnye umnyhadala oxatyiswe kakhulu yinkcubeko ngu "Umhlanga" okanye uMdaniso weReed. Ngo-2021 umxholo weMpondo Reed Dance wawusithi “Umgubho wentombi yamaMpondo”. Lo mnyhadala unemibala emihle nodlamkileyo ubhiyozela iintombi zamaXhosa ezingekatshati
uluntu. Amantombazana asuka kwiilali ezahlukahlukeneyo ayahlanganisana ukuze angqungqe aze acule, ehonjiswe ngesinxibo sakwantu yaye ephethe iingcongolo. Lo Mdaniso weReed awusebenzi nje kuphela njengeqonga lokubonisa ngenkcubeko yesiXhosa koko ukwakhuthaza umanyano nobudlelwane phakathi kwabasetyhini ekuhlaleni.
iKhwelo ngumbhiyozo wonyaka omtsha wesiXhosa. Lixesha lokuvuselelwa nokubulela kumaXhosa. Imibhiyozo idla ngokuba ngoSeptemba okanye ngo-Oktobha, ingqamana nokufika kwentwasahlobo eMzantsi Afrika. Umba obalulekileyo weKhwelo kukuxhelwa kwenkomo, nto leyo engumfuziselo wedini neentsikelelo zonyaka ozayo. Umsitho uqhutywa lixhwele. Inyama yenkomo ke ngoko kwabelwana ngayo phakathi koluntu njengophawu lomanyano nempumelelo. IKhwelo ikwalixesha lokubalisa amabali, imijuxuzo yesintu, nokucula. Lithuba lokuba abantu bacinge kunyaka odlulileyo kwaye babeke iinjongo zonyaka ozayo.
Le yimizekelo nje embalwa yemithendeleko neziganeko ezininzi ezibhiyozelwayo
ubutyebi belifa lenkcubeko yamaXhosa. Isiganeko ngasinye sisebenza njengesikhumbuzo sokuqina, umanyano, nokuzingca okuchaza umzi kaXhosa.
Ngokuthatha inxaxheba kule mithendeleko, amaXhosa akapheleli nje ekuhlonipheni izinyanya kodwa adlulisele namasiko nezithethe zawo kwizizukulwana ezizayo.
Le minyhadala nemisitho inika ithuba elikhethekileyo lokuzintywilisela kubutyebi benkcubeko yamaXhosa. Babonisa imvelaphi yembali yamaXhosa, uhambo lwabo ukusuka kuMbindi Afrika, kunye nokwahlukana kwabo kumaqela ahlukeneyo. Ngale mibhiyozo amaXhosa athe gqolo ukugcina nokubhiyozela ubuni bawo obukhethekileyo, eqinisekisa ukuba imbali yawo ebalaseleyo ihlala iphila kwizizukulwana ezizayo.
9.3. Ukuqukumbela, "Ungalahli imbo yakho ngophoyiyana".
Ndisoloko ndimangaliswe yindlela endisoloko ndifumana ngayo iimpendulo kwimibuzo yam yanamhlanje ngokuphethukela kulwazi lookhokho bam. Oku bekuyinyani ngakumbi xa bendisenza isigqibo ngeyona ndlela ibalaseleyo yemfundo yabantwana bam. Nangona izixhobo zale mihla zidlale indima, eyona mpendulo yavela ekujongeni emva kwindlela ookhokho bam kunye noninzi lwabantu ababafundisayo abantwana babo kwakudala ngaphambi kokuba imfundo esemthethweni ibe yinto eqhelekileyo.
Uphando endilwenzileyo kule ncwadi lube ngamava anika ukukhanya ngokwenene. Ayikhange indikhuthaze nje ukuba ndihlole ezinye izizwe, iziduko nezizwe zaseMzantsi Afrika, koko ndingene nzulu ngakumbi kwimbali enika umdla nezithethe zezizwe zamaTshezi namaXaba, kodwa hayi endingazukuba ngomnye wabo.
Ndiye ndafumanisa iindlela zenkcubeko ezinyamezelayo kunye neendlela zokufundisa eziye zamelana novavanyo lwexesha, oludlule kwizizukulwana ezidlulileyo.
Imbali iye yasebenza njengesikhokelo sobulumko, ingapheleli nje ekuchazeni iziganeko ezenzekayo kodwa ikwasilumkisa nxamnye nokulahla izithethe zethu sikhethe iindlela ezidlulayo. Amabali, izithethe nobulumko obudluliswa kwesinye isizukulwana ukuya kwesinye abuphembeleli nje kuphela indlela abantwana abafundiswa ngayo kodwa kwanenkqubela yabo njengomntu ngamnye.
Ukubhala le ncwadi kuye kwayiqinisa ngakumbi ingcamango eyamiliselwa kum ngabazali bam, inkolelo eye yandikhokela kubo bonke ubomi bam: yokuba amaqhina abopha uluntu kunye omelele ngakumbi kuneyantlukwano esahlulayo.
Ukuba besinokulandela umnombo wethu kangangeenkulungwane, besiya kufumana ukhokho omnye phakathi kwabantu baseBantu, egxininisa umanyano lwethu lwendalo. Nangona kunjalo, ukuphonononga nzulu kwiingcambu zethu ukuze sifumane unxibelelwano nabantu abasuka kwimimandla eyahlukeneyo njengesizathu somanyano kusenokungasondezi ubuhlobo obusondeleyo, njengokuba kungazange kuthintele iyantlukwano kunye nokungavisisani kwabantu baBantu. Kungengxabano phakathi kwabantwana bakowenu, njengoko kubonwa kwibali elinzulu likaKayin noAbheli, apho sibona ukuzalwa kwebali elinamandla.
Amandla okwenene asekuvumeni kunye nokwamkela iimpawu esabelane ngazo namhlanje, sihlahlel indlela yoluntu olunenkqubela phambili olusebenzisa amandla ethu adibeneyo ukuphakamisa izizukulwana ezizayo.
Sinokhetho lokuphakamisa okubi, kodwa ukwenjenjalo kuya kuthetha ukugatya okulungileyo ukuba sifuna ukuthetha inyaniso. Ungquzulwano lwezizwe ngezizwe lubangele intlungu enkulu, enoba phakathi kwezizwe ngokwazo, amaKhoisan, okanye abemi bomthonyama baseMzantsi Afrika abasuka eNtshona okanye eMpuma. Siye sanyamezela ubunzima obubonakalayo xa sikwimfazwe, kodwa safumana uncedo oluninzi ngokuhlalisana nokusebenza kunye njengabemi boMzantsi Afrika.
Ukugcina nokubhiyozelwa kwenkcubeko yamaXhosa kubalulekile kuba ikhusela imvelaphi nemveli yethu. Ngokudlulisela amasiko, ulwimi, kunye nezithethe zethu kwizizukulwana ezizayo, siqinisekisa ukuba ilifa lenkcubeko yethu eyodwa lihlala linjalo. Olu londolozo aluloncedo lwethu nje kuphela koko lusenzela ukutyebisa uluntu lwaseMzantsi Afrika luphela. Inkcubeko nganye inegalelo kwimosaic edlamkileyo eyenza isizwe sethu sibe singaqhelekanga.
Ngaphezu koko, ukubhiyozelwa kwenkcubeko yamaXhosa kukhuthaza umoya wobunye nokumanyana phakathi kwamaXhosa. Ngemisitho yenkcubeko, iminyhadala, kunye nemisitho, siyadibana ukuze sihloniphe imbali yethu ekwabelwana ngayo kunye neenqobo ezisemgangathweni. Le mibhiyozo inika ithuba lokubalisa amabali, ukudanisa, umculo, kunye nesinxibo sesintu, ukomeleza ubuni bethu kunye nokwenza amaqhina aqinileyo kuluntu lwethu.
Ngokuqonda imvelaphi yethu yembali kunye nokwamkela izithethe zethu ezizodwa, sibeka imbeko kwizinyanya zethu, someleza indlela esizazi ngayo, kwaye sinegalelo kwinkcubeko edlamkileyo yaseMzantsi Afrika. Sifunda kwizinto ezisebenzayo kwaye silumke abo bangazange basebenze.

Intshayelelo.

Ingcamango yemfundo yasesikolweni iye yendela kwibutho labantu kangangokuba abanye bakulungele ukuyiyalela ngemithetho. Le ngcamango icebisa ukuba abafundisi-ntsapho, abalawuli nabezobupolitika bafanele benze isigqibo ngemfundo yabantwana bethu endaweni yabazali. UMthetho osayilwayo we-BELA ugrogrisa ulawulo lwabazali kwimfundo yabantwana babo ngokwenza ukuba amandla okwenza izigqibo abe kwindawo eyodwa.

Abezopolitiko bazenza ngathi baxhalabele impilo-ntle yabantwana ukuze bafumane iivoti. Izifundiswa ezixhaswa ngemali yinkxaso yabarhafi ziqinisekisa ezi ngcamango, kwaye abantu abaqeshwe njengeengcaphephe kunye neengcali bafumana inzuzo ngokusasaza iingcamango zezopolitiko ababasebenzelayo, kubandakanywa nekharityhulam yesizwe. Iinqobo ezisemgangathweni zemveli kunye nolwazi oludluliselwe kwizizukulwana ngezizukulwana azihoywa ngenxa yokukhetha iingcamango ezinenkqubela.

Ube yintoni umphumo?

Mzantsi Afrika ngonyaka angamashumi amabini anesithathu, unentswela-ngqesho ephezulu, izinga lolwaphulo-mthetho, kunye nabafumana izibonelelo zezentlalo ngaphezulu kwabahlawuli berhafu. Iinkonzo zikarhulumente namaqumrhu karhulumente ayasilela, izikolo namaziko emfundo ephakamileyo athwaxwa ngamahlazo orhwaphilizo, kwaye nezempilo azithembekanga.

Inkqubo yemfundo esesikweni ishiye ilizwe linezigulo ezininzi eluntwini nangona liqhayisa ngesona sizukulwana sifunde kakhulu. Ezi ngxaki zisisiphumo sezimvo ezixhasayo ezibeka phambili imfundo esesikweni ngaphezu kokuthatha inxaxheba kwabazali. Inkqubo iye yasilela, nto leyo eyandikhokelela ekubeni ndifune iindlela ezizezinye zemfundo yabantwana bam.

Ndiyavuma ukuba indlela yam isenokungasebenzi kumntu wonke, kodwa ikratshi elithatha imfundo esesikweni ifanele wonke umntu ibangele umonakalo omkhulu. Ukuba iziphumo ezincumisayo xa umntu emdala azikho ngenxa yemfundo esisiseko, kutheni sichitha ixesha nemali eninzi kuyo kwaye sincama ixesha elixabisekileyo nabantwana bethu?

Ndiyala ukufundisa abantwana bam inkqubo yesikolo engaphumeleliyo, ngokungathi yeyona ndlela inye. Sonke siphuma kwizinyanya ezithe, kude kube mva nje, zingazange zifundise abantwana babo ngendlela esesikweni kodwa endaweni yoko bagxile ekufundiseni abantwana babo ekhaya ngokungacwangciswanga.

Ndikuqonda oku, ndiye ndafunela usapho lwam amanye amathuba.
Icandelo lokuqala: Kutheni?
Inkqubo yesikolo esesikweni.

Imfundo yasekhaya yindlela ehlonitshwa ixesha yokufundisa abantwana. Yandulela imfundo emiselweyo kuzo zonke iinkcubeko kwaye ibonisa umnqweno womzali wokukhokela imfundo yomntwana wakhe kwikhaya losapho. Le ndlela yokufundisa ayinikezeli nje kuphela ulwazi oluyimfuneko, izakhono, kunye neenqobo ezisemgangathweni kwimfundo ethe kratya, ingqesho, nobulungu obusebenzayo boluntu, kodwa ikwabonelela nokuguquguquka nokufikelela kwizibonelelo zokufunda ezahlukeneyo.

Imeko yembali yemfundo yaseMzantsi Afrika isinika ukukhanya kwisithethe esindele nzulu seentsapho kunye noluntu olungabahlohli abaphambili babantwana, lubanika izakhono eziyimfuneko ukuze baphile negalelo loluntu. Ukuzinikela kule mfundo kwakuqhutywa ngumdla wokwenene wokuxhobisa abantwana ngezakhono zokusebenza, nto leyo eyathi yaneziphumo ezibonakalayo kusapho nakuluntu ngokubanzi. Nakwimeko yamaziko asesikweni kunye noqeqesho olucwangcisiweyo, ukubaluleka kweenkqubo zemfundo ezingekho sikweni kuhleli kucacile.

Utshintsho olusuka kwimfundo engacwangciswanga ukuya ekuqalisweni kwemfundo emiselweyo, ekuqaleni kusetyenziswa izikolo zabavangeli basemazweni, luye lwavelisa iindidi ngeendidi zamaziko emfundo akhoyo namhlanje. Nangona kunjalo, ukubaluleka kwembali nenkcubeko yemfundo yasekhaya kunye neenkqubo zemfundo ezingekho sesikweni zisebenza njengesikhumbuzo esinyanzelisayo sonxibelelwano olunzulu phakathi kwemfundo noluntu, olufikelela ngaphaya kwemida yokufunda elungiselelwe iziko.

1.1. Ukuthelekiswa kwezikolo zikaRhulumente nezabucala.

Inkxaso-mali nobunini bumisela ukuba ngaba isikolo sesikarhulumente okanye sabucala. Izikolo zoluntu, okanye izikolo zikarhulumente, zifumana uninzi lwenkxaso-mali yazo kubahlawuli berhafu, ngelixa izikolo zabucala zixhaswa ngemali ngabazali.

Izikolo zikarhulumente ezibonelela abantu abangathathi ntweni zisimahla kubo, kwaye kufuneka zamkele bonke abafundi, nokuba ithini na imeko yezemali okanye uphononongo lwezifundo zabo. Ezi zikolo zihlelwe ukuqala kwi Quantum 1 ukuya kwi Quantum 3.

Izikolo zikarhulumente ezibhatalisayo ziqala kwi-Quantile 4, ezona zibiza kakhulu ebazalini zikwi Quantile 5, eyokugqibela. Zona zinokukhuphisana nezikolo zabucala eziphezulu kuba zinezibonelelo ezaneleyo ezivela kwimirhumoi eziziqokelelayo.

Izikolo zabucala zisebenza ngokuzimeleyo kurhulumente kwaye zinokubonelela ngenkolo ethile okanye ukhetho lwemfundo. Izikolo ezibizayo, ezibhekiselele kuzo zombini izikolo zabucala kunye nezikolo zikarhulumente ezihlawulisa kakhulu kwi-quantile 5, zithi zifundisa imfundo ekumgangatho ophezulu ukuthethelela amaxamiso aphezulu kuzo.

Zombini izikolo zikarhulumente nezikolo zabucala zijolise ekuboneleleni ngemfundo, ngendlela eqhelekileyo ebandakanya ukuya kwindawo yezakhiwo zesikolo, zinexesha lokungena nokuphuma, ezineeshedyuli ezimiselweyo kunye nekharityhulamu. Ukufunda kude kuyenye indlela ebikade iyinzuzo ngokwembali kubantu abadala abasebenzayo abafuna ukuqhubela phambili ngemfundo yabo besuka kude, kwaye i-intanethi iye yatshintsha le ndlela ngokuvumela ukuhamba bukhoma kwiiklasi ezikude, okwenza inkqubo yokufunda ifikeleleke ngakumbi kubafundi bayo yonke iminyaka.

1.2. Ukuthelekiswa kwezikolo ezisemthethweni, imfundo ekude kunye nokuzifundisela ekhaya.

Kubalulekile ukugxininisa ukuba zombini izikolo ezisemthethweni kunye ne-intanethi zibonelela ngomxholo wemfundo ofanayo, zahluke kuphela kwindlela ezizinikezela ngayo. Ezinye izikolo zikarhulumente nezabucala ezisesikweni ziye zahlanganisana ukuze zinike ezinye zeeklasi zazo kwi-Intanethi, ngakumbi ukusukela oko kwavalwa ngo-2020 xa ukufikelela kumasango esikolo kwakusikelwe umda.

Imfundo ekwi-Intanethi, ekwabizwa ngokuba kukufunda kude, akufuneki ibhidaniswe nokufunda ekhaya. Abafundi abafunda besekhaya okanye kuyo nayiphi na enye indawo basalandela ikharityhulam yesikolo esekiweyo kwaye babambelele kwikhalenda yesikolo kunye neshedyuli yemihla ngemihla, abazali bedlala indima ebonakalayo, njengakwizikolo zikarhulumente okanye kwizikolo zabucala.

Imfundo yasekhaya yahlukile kwisikolo sasekhaya, esilandela imodeli yemfundo esesikweni. Kwisikolo sasekhaya, abazali bathabatha uxanduva lokuhlela nokuvavanya, bethatha le misebenzi endaweni katitshala.

Imfundo yasekhaya inika abazali indima enkulu njengabahlohli baseprayimari, inika ukuguquguquka ngakumbi ngokwekharityhulam. Izixhobo ze-Intanethi kunye nabathengisi babonelela ngezinto eziyimfuneko, iiklasi ezirekhodiweyo okanye eziphilayo, kunye nezixhobo zokuvavanya ukuxhasa abazali kule ndima.

Izikolo ezisesikweni zihlala zijamelana nokugxekwa ngokungaqapheli izakhono ezizodwa zomfundi ngamnye ngenxa yendlela yazo eqhelekileyo. Kulapho ikharityhulam ye-eclectic ingena khona. Le kharityhulamu yobuqu ibhetyebhetye kakhulu kwaye isebenzisa iindlela ezahlukeneyo zokufundisa ukukhawulelana neemfuno kunye nezinto anomdla kuzo umntwana ngamnye.

Ikharityhulam ye-eclectic iyavuma ukuba abazali kunye namalungu entsapho banokuqonda okusondeleyo ngabantwana babo. Iimpawu zabo ezizodwa zibenza babe ngabafundisi abafanelekileyo kwimisebenzi ethile, beyila amava okufunda omntu ngamnye. Kanye njengokuba abantwana bezuza njengelifa iimpawu zokwenyama kubazali babo nakumalungu entsapho, bakwazuza njengelifa iimpawu zobuntu ezinokuphembelela iindlela zokufunda abazikhethayo.

Xa kucingwa ukuba abazali namalungu entsapho anokuhlola ubuchule bomntwana ngokusekelwe kwindlela akhuliswe ngayo, imizila yemfuza nobuchule bakhe, bafanele babe nendima ebalulekileyo ekuxonxeni ikharityhulam.
Kwakutheni ukuze ndiqalise.
Ingxaki yezemfundo yaseMzantsi Afrika iphinde yavela kwakhona ngo 2023, idiza ukuba ngaphezu kwamashumi asibhozo epesenti yabafundi bebanga lesine bayasokola ukufunda ukuze bafumane intsingiselo. Olu gcino-manani lothusayo lukhutshwe ngo 2021 lweNkqubela kuFundo loLwazi lokuFunda nokuBhala lwaMazwe ngaMazwe (PIRLS) lufuna ingqwalasela engxamisekileyo. Imeko enkenenkene yokufunda phakathi kwabantwana abafunda kwizikolo zikarhulumente ezixhaswa yirhafu ngokufanelekileyo baye bafumana iindaba ezibanzi kumajelo eendaba, kweli lizwe nakumazwe ngamazwe. Imeko eqhubekayo yokungakwazi ukufunda kakuhle kule minyaka idlulileyo ayinakubethwa ngoyaba, njengoko igxininisa imfuneko engxamisekileyo yezisombululo ezisebenzayo nezizinzileyo zokuphucula inkqubo yemfundo yeli lizwe. Lixesha lokuba urhulumente, ingakumbi uMphathiswa weMfundo esiSiseko, athathele ingqalelo ngokupheleleyo kwaye asombulule imiba ethe gqolo eqhubayo ukuba nefuthe kwikamva labantwana baseMzantsi Afrika.

2.1. Iingxaki ngenkqubo yesikolo esesikweni.

Imiba ejongene nenkqubo yezikolo emiselweyo eMzantsi Afrika ibonakala ngaphandle kwesidingo sokuphonononga uphando lwezifundo. Urhwaphilizo lugqugqisile, luphambukisa izibonelelo ezikolweni kwaye lunceda umntu ngamnye. Ngaphezu koko, umgangatho weziseko zophuhliso uhlala uphantsi, kwaye ezinye izakhiwo ziye ziwohloke phambi kokuba zigqitywe. Ngaphaya koku, imingeni yoluntu efana nolwaphulo-mthetho, ukufudukela kwabantu ezidolophini, kunye nentswela-ngqesho iqhubela phambili kwidabi lecandelo lezemfundo.

Le miba inefuthe elithe ngqo ekuqeshweni kwabathweswe izidanga, kwaye izinga lentswelo-ngqesho kulutsha lwaseMzantsi Afrika liphezulu ngokumangalisayo. ISebe leMfundo ePhakamileyo lichonge ukunqongophala kokuqonda ukufunda” njengeyona ntsilelo iphezulu yezakhono kwimarike yezemisebenzi.” Nangona iSebe leMfundo esiSiseko linombono woluntu oluphumelelayo nolunedemokhrasi, inyaniso ikude lee kulo mbono.

Inkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo exhaswa ngerhafu isebenzise kakubi izibonelelo zabarhafi yaza yaqhubela phambili iyantlukwano yoluntu. Ubume obusisinyanzelo bemfundo yasesikolweni yaphunyezwa ngolawulo lowiso-mthetho, njengoko uMgaqo-siseko ungayichazi imfundo esesikweni njengeyona ndlela yokubonelela ngemfundo esisiseko. Oku kuthandabuza ukuba semthethweni kokunyanzelwa kwabantu kwinkqubo yemfundo.

2.2. Izikolo zikarhulumente zeprayimari nezikolo zabucala zisisicombululo, akunjalo?

Ukwanda kweengcebiso zabakhweli bobuhlanga kugxekwa kanobom liZiko loBudlelwane bobuhlanga (IRR), elijolise ekubhentsiseni izenzo zala makhwekhwetha." Ipesenti encinci yamaxhala kubemi baseMzantsi Afrika, kunye nemiba efana nentswela-ngqesho, ulwaphulo-mthetho, iimeko zokuhlala, kunye nemfundo exhalabisa kakhulu.

Ingcamango yokuba izikolo ezikumgangatho ophantsi ziphezulu ngokwemvelo kunezikolo zikarhulumente ezikumgangatho ophantsi nayo iyathandabuzeka. Nangona amaziko emfundo enomsila esenokubonakala enegalelo elibonakalayo ekufundiseni ngemfundo ekumgangatho ophezulu, kuya kuba bubudenge ukuthi amanani awo aphumeleleyo aphezulu ngenxa yempumelelo yawo kuphela. Oku kungenxa yokuba la maziko abakhetha ngononophelo abafundi bawo phambi kokuba bamkelwe kwaye abeke nemiqobo yezemali. Ke ngoko, kubalulekile ukuvuma ukuba impumelelo yabo ayinakuvunywa kuphela ngenxa yokufaneleka kwabo.

Ngaphezu koko, izityholo zocalucalulo ngokobuhlanga kwizikolo ezikumgangatho ophezulu ziye zakhokelela kuphando olubiza imali eninzi, ekugqibeleni lusilele ukuvelisa ubungqina obuxhasa la mabango. Ukongeza, imfundo karhulumente neyabucala ichatshazelwa ziimeko zentlalo noqoqosho kunye nemigaqo-nkqubo yokunikwa kwabo amathuba okuba babonelelwe, ngokuncipha kokufaneleka njengeyona ndlela iphambili yokuqesha kuwo omabini amacandelo kunye nokungakwazi ukuyekisa abasebenzi abangakwaziyo ukwenza umsebenzi ngenxa yeziphumo zomthetho.

Kwakhona amava obuqu ayayiphikisa ingcamango yokuba ukuya kwizikolo ezikumgangatho ophezulu kuqinisekisa impumelelo. Nangona ndifunda kwizikolo zikarhulumente ezingenazibonelelo, mna, kunye noontanga bam, siphumelele inqanaba lempumelelo kunye nomgangatho wobomi ocel' umngeni uluvo lwezikolo ezikumgangatho ophezulu njengenzuzo epheleleyo.

Lo nto ibangele ukuba ndizibuze ukuba yintoni ekhokelele kwimpumelelo yam nangona ndifunda kwizikolo ezinqongopheleyo? Ezi ngcamango zixhokonxa ingcinga zicela umngeni kwiinkolelo eziqhelekileyo malunga nemiba yobuhlanga kunye nokuphakama kwezikolo ezihloniphekileyo, zibonelela ngombono onyanzelisayo kwizinto eziyinyani ezinefuthe kwimpumelelo kwimfundo nakwimisebenzi yobungcali.
Ngaba inkqubo yesikolo esesikweni iyavakala okanye yeza ingqondo?

Ukuba awuzange uphonononge izinto ezingaphaya kwezi zifundiswa zizikolo okanye ungene ezincwadini ngaphandle kofundo olufunekayo, uyaphoswa kokona kubalulekileyo kwehlabathi. Uninzi lwabantu lucwangcisiwe nje, alufundanga ngenene, ukucacisa ngenye indlela isithethi esiphambili sehlabathi kunye nombhali uNicky Verd.

Xa ndikhangela emva kumava am, ngoku ndiyakwazi ukuvakalisa iimvakalelo zam zokwenene ngesikolo. Andizange ndikubuze ukuya esikolweni ndisengumntwana. Kwakungokwemvelo njengokuphefumla okanye isibhakabhaka nomhlaba, okanye ke ndafundiswa ukuba ndikholelwe. Kwakuyimfuneko ukuze uphile, into ongenakukwazi ukuba noluvo ngayo. Noko ke, ekubeni ngoku ndinenkululeko yokubuza nokucinga, ndiyaqonda ukuba ndandingasithandi isikolo. Okumangalisayo kukuba, iirekhodi zam zemfundo zinokucebisa ngenye indlela. Inyaniso kukuba, ndagqwesa ezifundweni kuba ndandifuna ukubaleka ngokukhawuleza kangangoko ndandinako. Kwasebuncinaneni bam, bendisoloko ndiziva ndikhululekile xa ndikwikhaya lam. Ngoko, ngoxa isikolo sasinikela uhlobo oluthile lokufunda, ngokufuthi sasivakalelwa njengohlobo oluthile lokuthuthunjiswa.

3.1. Izinto ezingavakaliyo ngemfundo yasesikolweni.

Ngaba indlela yokufundisa yezikolo esesikweni yeyona ilungileyo kubafundi abohlukeneyo? 

Ekukhuleni kwam, kwakufuneka ndihambe imigama emide xa ndisiya esikolweni, ndijamelene nemozulu embi kunye neengozi. Ubukhulu becala ndandifunda ngokuphulaphula ootitshala nokufumana iimpendulo eziyimizekelo kwiimviwo. Ukucinga okunzulu akuzange kukhuthazwe.

Imisebenzi yezemidlalo yayisisinyanzelo, nokuba ayiyonwatyiswa okanye ayidingeki. Ugonyamelo lwaluxhaphakile, phezu kwazo nje iinkolelo zokuba imidlalo yayinokunceda ekupheliseni utyekelo lwethu lokuba ndlongondlongo njengamakhwenkwe aselula.

Izikolo zazibonwa njengezona mithombo ziphambili zokhathalelo lwabantwana xa abazali besebenza, kodwa xa kuqwalaselwa izinga lentswela-ngqesho elandayo namhlanje, oku akusenamanzi. Ngaphambili, iintsapho ezininzi zazixhomekeke kumthombo omnye womvuzo, ngoxa omnye umzali ehlala ekhaya ukuze anyamekele abantwana. Eli lungiselelo langqineka liyingenelo kwimpilo-ntle nakuphuhliso lwabantwana.

Kwezinye iimeko, xa bobabini abazali bezibophelele kwingqesho emiselweyo, ootitshala baye baba ngabalondolozi babanye abantu. Ngoku sibona iziphumo zokubandakanyeka okuncinci kwabazali kunye nemingeni esijongene nayo isizukulwana esasithembele kakhulu kootishala.

Ixesha endandinokulichitha nabazali bam lalincinane ngenxa yesikolo, nto leyo eyayisiba nzima nangakumbi kum kuba utata wasweleka ndineminyaka elishumi nanye. Kwafuneka ndilishiye ikhaya ukuze ndifumane imfundo ebhetele emva kokusweleka kwakhe. Oku kwandenza ndafuna ukuyiqonda ngakumbi inkqubo yemfundo, ngakumbi njengoko ndandilungiselela ukuba nabantwana bam. 

Ndandingafuni ukuba badlule kumava anzima afanayo. Indlela abaqhuba ngayo abafundi abaphumelele esikolweni emva ko-1994 ibonise ifuthe elibi lenkqubo yezemfundo.

3.2. Ubuncinane inkqubo yesikolo esesikweni iyabafundisa abantu, akunjalo?

Ukuba besinokuvuma ukuba uhambo lwethu lwemfundo lubumba ubuni bethu kwaye lumisela ikamva lethu, njengoko likhuthazwa ngabaxhasi bemfundo yasesikolweni, oko kuya kuthetha ukuba abantu abagqibileyo imfundo yabo, njengesikolo samabanga aphakamileyo, baya kufumana iziphumo ezifanayo okanye ubuncinane ezithelekisekayo, ngenxa yokuba baye bafunda ikharityhulam efanayo. 

Abo bafunda kwizikolo zikarhulumente ezihlelelekileyo babeya kuba nelona nqanaba lisezantsi lokuphumelela, kanye njengokuba abo bafunda kwizikolo ezibizayo zikarhulumente okanye zabucala ezikumgangatho ophezulu babeya kuba neziphumo ezithelekisekayo phezulu.

Nangona kunjalo, inyani ikude kwizinto esizibonayo xa sijonga iziphumo zokwenyani, ngakumbi kwicala elilungileyo.

Ngoxa isikolo siyinxalenye yobomi kwabaninzi, impembelelo yaso kwimpumelelo okanye ekusileleni komntu idla ngokubabaxa. Kusenokuba sengqiqweni ukucinga ukuba abantu abafunda kwizikolo ezifanayo babeya kuba neziphumo ezifanayo okanye ubuncinane ezithelekisekayo, inyaniso yahluke lee!

Ukuba imfundo yasesikolweni idlala indima encinci kangaka kwiziphumo zabantu, kutheni ke sityala ixesha elininzi kunye nezibonelelo kuyo? Kutheni sincama amaxesha axabisekileyo nabantwana bethu njengabazali, sisazi ukuba asinakuze silibuyise elo xesha, ukuze nje bakwazi ukuya esikolweni? Siyithathe njani yaye nini le ndlela yokucinga?

Ngo-2023, imeko inokuba ngakumbi malunga nesizukulwana "esizelwe sikhululekile". Inani elibalulekileyo labantu abasuka kwixesha lasemva ko-1994 abaphelelanga nje ekugqibezeleni amabanga aphantsi naphakamileyo ngempumelelo kodwa baye bakhetha ukuqhubela phambili nemfundo ephakamileyo kwinqanaba lemfundo ephakamileyo. Oku kufanele kukhokhelele kumazinga angcono empumelelo kunezizukulwana zangaphambili ezingafundanga kangako, njengoko kwakuthenjisiwe ngabathetheleli besikolo abasesikweni.

Inyaniso yahluke ngokupheleleyo.

Esi sizukulwana, nangona sineminyaka emininzi yokufunda ngokusesikweni, eneneni siqhuba kakubi ngakumbi kunangaphambili. Abaninzi baye baxhomekeke kwinkxaso-mali yerhafu kwaye babambelele kumjikelo wokungaqeshwa. Ziye zaba ngumthwalo ongunaphakade kubahlawuli berhafu nakubazali babo. Ngenxa yoko, abazali bajamelene nokungaqiniseki ngobudala babo, njengoko kufuneka basebenze ixesha elide okanye bathembele kumvuzo wabo womhlala-phantsi ukuze banyamekele abantwana babo nabazukulwana.
4. Imvelaphi yezembali yenkqubo yemfundo esesikweni.

Kubalulekile ukuqonda ukuba izenzo ezinjengenkolo yamaKrestu nemfundo zendele nzulu kwinkcubeko yethu, zibengathi azinakuthandabuzwa futhi zingaphaya kwemibuzo. Nangona kunjalo, xa kuhlolisiswa ngokusondeleyo, kuyacaca ukuba ezi zenzo zinokuba neziphumo ezimbi kwixesha elide.

Kusukelo lwam lolwazi nokuqonda, ndiye ndachitha ixesha lam elininzi lokuzonwabisa ukuze ndingene ezincwadini nakwiingxelo ezibonisa ukukhanya kwezi zifundo. Ndiye ndachukunyiswa ndaza ndakhanyiselwa koko ndikufundileyo.

Ngoxa ndisenokungasoloko ndikuxabisa ukufunda imbali, ndiye ndakuthanda ukuqonda okuxabisekileyo okuzuzwe ngokuhlolisisa ixesha elidluleyo. Ukufumana umxholo wembali yosapho lwam kunye nokuphonononga imbali yoluntu lwam kunye noluntu luphela kungqineke kubaluleke kakhulu ekubumbeni ikamva lam. Kunyaka wamashumi amabini anesithathu, ndiziva ndinethamsanqa ukufumana ithuba lokuphengulula kwimisebenzi etsala umdla yababhali bokuqala abathi baqalisa inkqubo yokubhala kunye nokugcinwa kweerekhodi.

4.1. Yaqala nini yaye phi yonke le nto?

Imbali yenkqubo yesikolo yangoku inkulu kwaye intsonkothile, kodwa ndiza kuchukumisa imiba echaphazelekayo. Ukuqonda izinto ezinempembelelo eziye zamisela inkqubo yemfundo ibe yile nto iyiyo namhlanje kubalulekile. Iye yaba yimodeli yefektri esemgangathweni, ithintela ubuchule kunye nokuvelisa abantu abathobelayo. Le modeli ayiguquguquki kuphela eNtshona kodwa naseMzantsi Afrika.

Imfundo nenkolo bezisoloko zinxibelelene ngokusondeleyo. Izikolo zokuqala ezisesikweni zinokulandelwa ukuya kumawaka amathathu BC kunye namaSumeri namaJiphutha, befundisa abafundi ukufunda nokubhala. Ngewaka ngaphambi kweXesha Eliqhelekileyo, izikolo zonqulo eSiriya zazifundisa imibhalo engcwele yesiHebhere, kodwa babembalwa ababenelungelo lokuzifumana. UConfucius wavula izikolo zokuqala zomntu wonke, kungekhona nje abantu abaphezulu.

Ngotshintsho olusuka kumzingeli-umqokeleli ukuya kuluntu lwezolimo, imfuno yemfundo yakhula. Abantwana kwakufuneka bafunde izakhono ezifunekayo kumsebenzi wezandla kwezolimo. Kwagxininiswa intobelo nentlonelo, yaye umoya wemvukelo wawunokuba nemiphumo ebuhlungu. Ukukhula kwexesha lemizi-mveliso kuye kwanyusa ngakumbi imfuneko yabasebenzi abathobelayo nabathobelayo.

4.2. Iziqalo zokwenyani kumiliselo olukrokrisayo.

Imfundo esesikweni yasekwa ngeenjongo ezintle, ngenjongo yokuphucula uluntu. Nangona kunjalo, iye yasetyenziswa kakubi ekuhambeni kwexesha. Inkqubo yemfundo yasesikolweni iye yagqwethwa ngokuthe ngcembe ngabantu abafuna inzuzo yobuqu, becinezela abarhafi besebenzisa abantwana njengeemali zabo. 

UMartin Luther, umfundisi waseJamani, waba nendima ebalulekileyo ekuphunyezweni kwemfundo yesinyanzelo phesheya. Injongo yakhe yayikukwenza iBhayibhile ifumaneke ngakumbi kumakholwa ngokukhuthaza imfundo kawonke-wonke.

IJamani yawisa imithetho ngenkulungwane yeshumi elinesixhenxe, yenza imfundo ibe sisinyanzelo kwaye iqhutywe yicawe yamaLuthere. Ngenkulungwane yeshumi elinesibhozo, iJamani yayinenkqubo yemfundo exhaswa ngerhafu, eyaphembelela amanye amazwe, kuquka iUnited States.

Oosomashishini eMelika bafuna ukudala abasebenzi abaya kuthi ngokuthobela bavumelane kwaye bangababuze abo baphetheyo. Amaziko abucala afana neBhodi yeMfundo Jikelele, exhaswa ngemali ngoosomashishini abazizityebi abafana no-John D. Rockefeller no-Andrew Carnegie, babumba inkqubo yemfundo ngokwemibono yabo.

Ukuthatha inxaxheba kukarhulumente kwimfundo emiselweyo kuye kwanda ngokusekwa kwezikolo zikarhulumente ezixhaswa ngerhafu. Ngeminyaka elishumi elinesithoba, ukuya esikolweni kwaba sinyanzelo kumazwe aseMelika. Umbono wokubumba abantu ukuze bafanelekele iimfuno zoluntu nokungakhathaleli usukelo lwengqondo waba ngundaba-mlonyeni.

Kuyadanisa ukubona indlela amalinge aneenjongo ezintle anokujijwa ngayo aze agqwethwe ngabantu abaqhutywa kukuzingca. Inkqubo yemfundo esesikweni, ecetyelwe ukunika amandla nokukhanyisa, ngokufuthi iye yaba lixhoba lamandla anjalo.

4.3. Imfundo esesikweni eMzantsi Afrika.

NgokukaGqirha Hendrik Verwoerd, umphathiswa wemicimbi yemveli kwiminyaka yeshumi elinesithoba umgaqo-nkqubo wezemfundo wesebe lemveli ugxininise ukubaluleka kokumiliselwa kwemfundo kwiindawo zomthonyama kunye noluntu lwaseMzantsi Afrika. Kwakubalulekile ukukhokela abantu baBantu ukuba bakhonze uluntu lwabo kwaye bazimele ngaphakathi.

Uphuhliso lwembali lwenkqubo yemfundo esesikweni yelizwe lubonakalisa imingeni ejongene neentlanga ezahlukeneyo. Lo mxholo wembali unika ukukhanya kubuntsokotha nemizabalazo yenkqubo yemfundo yaseMzantsi Afrika.

Ukususela xa izikolo zokuqala ezisesikweni zaziswayo yi-Dutch Cape Colony ukuya ekubandakanyekeni kwecawe yobuKristu kunye nokutshintshwa ngokuthe ngcembe kolawulo lusuka kumaziko enkolo lusiwe kurhulumente lubonise utshintsho olutshintshayo lwemfundo.

Iimpembelelo zembali ngaphandle kwamathandabuzo ziye zayila zaqinisa imfundo esesikweni njengomgangatho wentlalo, kodwa inkqubela esele iphunyeziwe iye yaphazanyiswa ngamandla ezoqoqosho, ezentlalo, kunye nezopolitiko ukusukela kwishumi elinesithoba lamashumi alithoba anesine. Xa kujongwa imeko yelizwe ngoku, inkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo ilishiye ilizwe likwimeko embi kakhulu.


5. Eyona njongo yenkqubo yemfundo esesikweni, njengoko sibona ngeziphumo.

Ukusukela kwishumi elinesithoba elinamashumi alithoba anesine, uMzantsi Afrika ubone isizukulwana esifunde kakhulu sivela, kodwa iziphumo zoku kwanda kwemfundo azikhange ikhokelele kuphuculo olulindelekileyo kweli lizwe. Phezu kwawo nje amanani aphakamileyo obhaliso nokugxininiswa kwemfundo esesikweni, indlela eliqhuba ngayo ilizwe kwiinkalo ezibalulekileyo ezifana nentswela-ngqesho, ulwaphulo-mthetho nokukhula koqoqosho ayikafikeleli izithembiso ezenziwa kubahlawuli berhafu nakubazali.

Inkqubo yemfundo iye yasilela ekuxhobiseni abaphumeleleyo ngezakhono ezisebenzayo, nto leyo ekhokelela ekubeni bangayikhathaleli imisebenzi yezandla nokungabi namdla wokwenza umsebenzi wezandla. Uqhawulo lonxibelelwano phakathi kwemfundo esesikweni kunye nobuchule behlabathi lokwenyani lukwabonwa kukunqongophala komsebenzi kumaqumrhu karhulumente anabasebenzi abaphumelele izidanga, uninzi lwabo lubonise ukutyekela kuburhwaphilizo endaweni yonikezelo lweenkonzo olunempumelelo.

Imeko yezopolitiko yonakaliswe ngamahlazo kunye nokungasebenzi kakuhle, okubangela ukuba kube kuthandatyuzwa ukusebenza ngempumelelo kwenkqubo yemfundo yeli lizwe ekuveliseni abemi abathembekileyo, abanobuchule. Ngenxa yoko, uMzantsi Afrika uzifumana ukwimeko enzima, neziphumo zemigaqo-nkqubo yezobusoshiyali kunye nentshukumo eqinisekisiweyo ziyenza mandundu ngakumbi imeko.

Ngenxa yezi nyaniso zokwenene, kubalulekile ukuvavanya iziphumo eziyinyani zenkqubo yemfundo esesikweni kwaye ubuze ukuba yintoni kanye kanye esele ifikelele kuyo.

5.1. Ukuphanga noRhwaphilizo.

Uphononongo loHlahlo-lwabiwo-mali lwamashumi amabini ananye olwenziwa nguNondyebo weSizwe luveza ukuba ulwabiwo lwelizwe lokufunda nenkcubeko kuqikelelwa ukuba luya kukhula kakhulu kule minyaka imbalwa izayo. ISebe leMfundo esiSiseko (DBE) lifumana esona sabelo sikhulu kuwo onke amasebe, isixa-mali esimangalisayo esizibhiliyoni zeeRandi ezingama-255.1. Nangona kunjalo, kuyabonakala ukuba ezi mali zabarhafi zisetyenziselwe inzuzo yomntu liqela elilawulayo.

Ukudalwa kwezikhundla ezongezelelweyo zobuphathiswa kumashumi amabini aneshumi kwisebe lezemfundo kukhokelele ekonyukeni kweendleko kubahlawuli berhafu, kuxhamle amalungu eqela athembekileyo. Isizathu sikarhulumente solu lwahlulo yayikukuphucula unikezelo lweenkonzo nokusebenza kakuhle. Noko ke, imiphumo iye yanelisa.

Isebe lemfundo esisiseko lenze inkcitho engaqhelekanga efikelela kwinqaku leebhiliyoni ezine zeerandi, kwaye uMphathiswa weMfundo ePhakamileyo, obambe isikhundla sakhe ukusukela kumashumi amabini aneshumi, akakhange abonakalise mpucuko ibonakalayo kwisikhundla sakhe. Urhwaphilizo kunye nokuxhasana kudlulela ngaphaya kokuqeshwa kwangaphakathi, ngeethenda ezinikezelwa ngokusekelwe kunxibelelwano lwezopolitiko endaweni yexabiso okanye umgangatho.

Lo mkhuba worhwaphilizo ugqugqisile kwinkqubo yezemfundo, ngeengxelo zokusetyenziswa gwenxa kwezibonelelo, ulawulo olugwenxa, nokusetyenziswa kakubi kwegunya ezikolweni.

Kwanamaziko anembali ebekekileyo, afana neUNISA neFort Hare, angcoliswe zizityholo zorhwaphilizo. Imiphumo yolu rhwaphilizo mibi, yaye ubomi babantu buyachaphazeleka yaye bude buphulukane. Liyothusa inani lamantombazana azalwayo aphakathi kweminyaka elishumi ukuya kwelishumi elinesithoba, amanye awo akhulelwa ngootishala neenqununu eziwasebenzisa kakubi amagunya awo.

Kucacile ukuba uhlahlo lwabiwo-mali lwezemfundo lusetyenziswe ngendlela engeyiyo ukuze kuzuze yena, kujongelwa phantsi inkqubela yelizwe. Oku kuxhaphazwa ngabom kweemali zabarhafi ukuze kuxhamle umbutho olawulayo kukungcatsha uMgaqo-siseko kunye nabantu besizwe. Eyona njongo yale nkqubo yesikolo yayingelokunceda ilizwe lilonke, kodwa kukusebenzela umbutho olawulayo.

Inkqubo yemfundo esesikweni ibe sisixhobo esisebenza kakhulu sokuba abezopolitiko baphange ilizwe ukuze bazisole.

5.2. Ukufundisa abantu ubuxoki nokubahlutha izakhono abanokuthi bazisebenzise ukuze bakwazi ukuzimela, ukuze baqhubeke bevotela umbutho olawulayo.

Ukuqinisekisa isiseko sovoto esizinzileyo kubalulekile kumaqela ezopolitiko, ingakumbi lawo angasekhohlo axhomekeke kwizithembiso simahla kunye noncedo lukarhulumente lokukhusela iivoti. Nangona kunjalo, esi sicwangciso asizinzile kwixesha elide, njengoko abantu beqaphela ukungafezeki kwezi zithembiso kwaye bafumana ulwazi malunga nemigaqo-nkqubo ye-libertarian ekhuthaza uxanduva lomntu kunye nenkululeko. Ukugcina igunya, iqela elilawulayo kufuneka lifumane amacebo asebenzayo okuqinisekisa ukuqhubeka kwawo elawula.

Isicwangciso esisebenzayo silele kwinkqubo yesikolo. Ngokuchaseneyo nenkolelo exhaphakileyo, umgangatho wemfundo ophantsi awubangelwa nje kukungaphumeleli, kodwa umzamo owenziwe ngabom weqela elilawulayo lokujongela phantsi inkqubo. Ngokuthintela abaphumeleleyo ekufumaneni ulwazi olwaneleyo nezakhono, iqela elilawulayo linokugcina ubuqhetseba balo kwaye lilawule izihlwele ngobuxoki. Olu qeqesho luqala besebancinci, apho abafundi bafundiswa ukugxeka abanye ngokusilela kukarhulumente kwaye bamkele imigaqo-nkqubo ekhuthaza ukulingana ngerhafu ephezulu kunye neyantlukwano yobuhlanga.

Urhulumente ukwaqinisekisa ukuba abantu baxhomekeke kuncedo loluntu, edala ukuthembela kumbutho olawulayo ukuze baphile. Ezi nkxaso-mali, nangona ziqale zaziswa njengezexeshana, azifane zivumele abo bazifumanayo ukuba bahlukane nokuxhomekeka kwabo. Ngokugcina abantu bethembele kurhulumente, umbutho olawulayo uzuza abalandeli bakhe ubomi bonke abaya kuqhubeka ubavotela, beqinisekisa ukuba bahlala belawula.

Inkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo idlala indima ebalulekileyo kwesi sicwangciso. Oorhulumente abacinezelayo babeka phambili kwaye benze imfundo ibe sisinyanzelo ukuze bafundise abemi kwaye bakhusele ukunyaniseka kwabo. Ingcamango ye-hard-left eye yakhawulezisa ukutshabalala kweNtshona kwaye isongela ikamva loluntu iye yaqiniswa ngemfundo esemthethweni, ngokuphindaphinda rhoqo amabali obuxoki kunye neengcamango ezingenasiphelo. Imalunga nelokuba abona bantu baneembono ezibaxiweyo badla ngokuba ngabathweswe izidanga kumaziko abalulekileyo, ekufuneka bazi ngcono kodwa baxhaphaze abanye. Kwanemibutho ebangela iyantlukwano neyonakalisayo efana neBlack Lives Matter, eyamkelwa ngabezobupolitika, iye yakhokelwa ngabantu abaxhamle kwimfundo enomsila.

Akumangalisi ukuba uninzi lweenjingalwazi zekholeji zichonga njengenkululeko, njengoko zidlala indima ephambili ekuguquleni abafundi abaphumeleleyo kunye nokugqwetha iinyaniso zendalo. Ubudlelwane phakathi kwabezobupolitika, amagosa karhulumente, neenkcuba-buchopho buyayibethelela ngakumbi le mfundiso. Abezopolitiko baxhomekeke kwiinkcuba-buchopho ukunika intembeko kwimigaqo-nkqubo yasekhohlo, ngelixa iinkcuba-buchopho ziwongwa ngenkxaso-mali yomrhafi kunye namanye amathuba okuzityebisa.

Lilonke, inkqubo yemfundo sisixhobo esinamandla sokudala ukuxhomekeka kunye nokuxhoma ingqondo kwabemi.

5.3. Ukwenza buthathaka impembelelo yabazali.
"Kunzima ukucinga indlela yobudenge okanye eyingozi ngakumbi yokwenza izigqibo kunokubeka ezo zigqibo ezandleni zabantu abangabhatali xabiso xa bephazamile"
Thomas Sowell

Abazali bam babesoloko bekholelwa ekubalulekeni kwemfundo. Ndandikuthanda ukufunda ndisengumntwana yaye ndabona indlela imfundo eyamnceda ngayo utata ukuze anyamekele intsapho yakowethu.

Noko ke, ndaqalisa ukuzibuza isizathu sokuba abanye abantwana bangavumi ukuya esikolweni. Kwakukho abazali ababechasa ngamandla kwaye bavakalisa inkxalabo yabo malunga nesikolo, besithi sivalela abantwana babo amava abalulekileyo okufunda kwihlabathi lokwenyani. Kulapho ndabona khona ukuba urhulumente unyanzelisa ngokusemthethweni abantwana ukuba baye esikolweni, nto leyo eyandibhidayo. 

Ukuba ukuya esikolweni kuyingenelo kangaka, kutheni kufuneka kwenziwe isinyanzelo?

Kutheni umtu eza kunyanzelwe ukuba enze okulungileyo kuye? Akukho mithetho yakhe yafuneka ukuze inyanzele abantu ukuba batye ukutya okanye baphefumle; Zonke izinto eziphilayo ziyakwazi ngethuku lemvelo oku kwaye ziyakwenza. Kunokuba abantu bachithe kuba bengatyi, ukutyeba kuyingxaki kumazwe ahambele phambili kwezoqoqosho. Imithetho imiselwe ukuba ithintele ukutya ukutya okuthile kuba zonke izinto eziphilayo ziyazi ukuba isondlo siyimfuneko.

Ugxininiso lukarhulumente kwimfundo enyanzelekileyo luye lwaphumela ekuncipheni kolawulo lwabazali kubantwana babo, nto leyo eyayiyinjongo kwasekuqaleni.

Akukhange kubekho sixhobo sikhulu sokuququzelela oku kuthotywa kwegunya labazali kunenkqubo yezikolo ezisesikweni. Imeko iyothusa kakhulu, nabaxhasi benkqubo yezemfundo bekhuthaza ukuba abantwana baqale isikolo bebancinci. Abazali badla ngokuxelelwa ukuba imfundo yabantwana iluncedo kuba ibavumela ukuba basebenze ngoxa umntwana wabo efunda.

Uphononongo kunye noqwalaselo olubonakalayo lubonise ukuba izinto eziluncedo kwimfundo yabantwana abasaqalayo azinampembelelo nje kuphela, kodwa zineziphumo ezibi ngokwenene kumntwana nakubazali.

5.4. Ukubaluleka koluntu kumxholo wosapho.

Namhlanje, igama elithi "uluntu" lihlala litolikwa gwenxa kwaye lisetyenziselwa ukunyanzela abantu ukuba bathwale imithwalo enxulumene nemfundo yoluntu. Ke ngoko, kuyabaluleka ukuseka inkcazo ecacileyo yeyona nto ibandakanya uluntu. Mandibonise oku ngokwabelana ngemizekelo esuka kwilali yam nakusapho lwam.

Ndazalelwa eeNtshatshongo, ilali esemaphandleni ekumgama oziikhilomitha ezilishumi ukusuka kunxweme lweMpuma Koloni. Kule lali, amakhaya ezalamane zam ezisondeleyo ayemi kufutshane, amaqhina ezalamane ayencipha njengoko umgama usanda. Lo mzekelo ubonakala kwilali kabawo, iNqabane, apho amalungu osapho ahlala kufutshane.

Ekukhuleni kwam, ngalo lonke ixesha ndityelela ezi lali, ndandiziva ndinolwalamano olomeleleyo nabantu ngenxa yobudlelane bethu bentsapho. Olu nxibelelwano lwandenza ndaziva ndingumntu ongomnye. Olu luvo lunamandla loluntu lwabangelwa kukuthontelana okuphantsi kwabantu bangaphandle ngokwembali nakwindlela eyayixhaphakile yokutshatana ezilalini. Ngenxa yoko, wonke umzali ekuhlaleni waziva enomdla kwintlalo-ntle yabo bonke abantwana, ebotshelelwe ngamaqhina obuzalwana.

Olu luntu lumanyeneyo lusebenze kunye kwaye lutyale imali kwinjongo enye. Ukuqulunqwa kolu luntu lwaluhlala luzinzile, kunye bambalwa nabantu abangaphandle abazibandakanyayo. Olu luvo lozinzo lwafaka ukuzithemba “kubatyali-zimali” ukuba izizukulwana zabo zexesha elizayo nazo ziya kuvuna ingenelo.

Izikolo zokuqala endazifundayo, zazakhiwe ngokuyintloko ngeenzame ezihlangeneyo zoluntu. Abazali badibanisa izixhobo zabo kwaye bakha ukwakha oko urhulumente angakwaziyo.

Nangona imali yayinqongophele, uluntu lwaluneqhayiya ngokusebenza kunye nokuphumeza oko lunokukwenza. Andizikhumbuli izihlandlo apho abantu bonakalisa ngabom ipropathi yesikolo kuba nabo beza kwenzakalisa into abayincedileyo yokwakha, yaye behlobene nomntu oza kuchatshazelwa ngulo monakalo.

Olu luntu lwalumanyane kwaye luzinikele kwiinjongo ekwabelwana ngazo, luqhutywa kukuqhelana kwabo ixesha elide kwizizukulwana ngezizukulwana kunye nentshukumo enyiniweyo yabantu abangena nokuphuma ezilalini.

Inkcazo efanayo yoluntu ayinakusetyenziswa kumaxesha angoku, ngakumbi kwinqanaba lesizwe, singasathethi ke ngamazwe ngamazwe.

Ngenxa yolu tshintsho, kuba yinto engekho ngqiqweni ukulindela ukuba abantu ngabanye bancede abantu abangabaziyo nabangenakuze badibane nabo. Aba bantu basemzini basenokuba ngabahlobo okanye ziintshaba, nto leyo eyenza kube nzima ngabo ukuba bamkelwe kwiilali ezintsha.


Icandelo lesibini: Apho ndiqale khona
6. Imfundo yasekhaya kunye noMthetho, uMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika. 

UMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika ngowona mthetho uphakamileyo welizwe, nawuphi na umthetho ongahambelaniyo nawo awusebenzi. Iqinisekisa ilungelo lemfundo esisiseko kumntu wonke. UMgaqo-siseko awuchazi ukuba yintoni efanelekela ukuba yimfundo esisiseko, uyiyekela kubazali nabagcini babantwana abasemthethweni ukuba benze isigqibo.

Urhulumente kufuneka aphumeze eli lungelo esebenzisa amanyathelo afanelekileyo, kwaye ukuba la manyathelo afunyaniswa engafanelekanga, uMgaqo-siseko uyoyisa. UMgaqo-siseko ukwabamkela abazali nosapho njengabona banonopheli babantwana kwaye uvumela kuphela ukhathalelo olulolunye ukuba kukho izizathu ezivakalayo zokukholelwa ukuba oko kuyimfuneko.

Njengomzali, ndinelungelo lokuyichasa imfundo yasesikolweni ukuba iphazamisana noxanduva lwam lokunyamekela umntwana wam. Kunzima ukuthethelela ukuthabatha abantwana kubazali babo baze bafundiswe baze banyanyekelwe ngabantu abangabaziyo, ngaphandle kokuba abazali nosapho baye babhengezwa njengengozi emntwaneni.

6.1. Ngaba ndophula umthetho ngokungamhambisi umntwana wam esikolweni?

Akunjalo. Ilungelo lesikolo sasekhaya likhuselwe nguMgaqo-siseko kwaye ityala likaSchneider likucacisile ukuba ukungathotyelwa kwemithetho ethile akuyi kuthathwa njengokwaphulwa komthetho.

Oku kuphakamisa imibuzo malunga negunya leSebe leMfundo esiSiseko lokulawula imfundo yasemakhaya. UMthetho weZikolo waseMzantsi Afrika, umzekelo, ugunyazisa ukuhamba isikolo ngokusesikweni ukususela kwiminyaka esixhenxe ukuya kwelishumi elinesihlanu kwaye uwise izohlwayo okanye ukuvalelwa entolongweni ngenxa yokungathobeli. Icandelo lamashumi amahlanu ananye likwafuna ukuba abazali babhalise abantwana abafunda emakhaya.

Umbutho olawulayo namahlakani alo azama ukuwisa uMthetho-siHlomelo osaYilwayo weMithetho yeMfundo esiSiseko, ojolise ekutyhaleleni abantwana kwinkqubo yemfundo esesikweni. Lo mthetho uyilwayo ujongene nenkcaso evela kumaqela ngamaqela, aquka i-AfriForum kunye ne-Institute of Race Relations (IRR), abathi ibeka amandla kwindawo eyodwa ezandleni zikaRhulumente kwaye ijongela phantsi ukubandakanyeka koluntu ezikolweni. Abazali abaninzi, kunye nemibutho efana nePestalozzi Trust, bamile ngokuchasene neli tyala. Amaqela aphikisayo afana neFreedom Front Plus (FF+), African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), kunye neDemocratic Alliance (DA) nawo avakalise inkcaso emandla.

Urhulumente akakhange ayeke kwiinzame zakhe zokutyhafisa ukufundiswa kwamakhaya, kodwa abazali kunye nemibutho yabameli bayalwa. Amagosa ezemfundo eKZN ade enze nzima ukuba abazali babhalisele ukufunda emakhaya, nto leyo ebangele ukuba iPestalozzi Trust ithathele amanyathelo asemthethweni.

6.2. Imfundo yasekhaya kunye noMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika.

Nangona iCandelo lamashumi amabini anesithoba lisenokubonakala lilelona candelo lifanelekileyo ekuphononongeni imfundo yasekhaya eMzantsi Afrika, eneneni liCandelo lamashumi amabini anesibhozo loMgaqo-siseko elibaluleke kakhulu. Eli candelo limisela ithoni kwaye lisebenza njengomgaqo osisikhokelo, libeka phambili intlalo-ntle kunye neemfuno ezingcono zomntwana kuyo yonke imiba enxulumene nabo.

NgoNovemba ishumi elinesithoba elinamashumi asibhozo anesithoba, iNgqungquthela yeZizwe eziManyeneyo ngamaLungelo oMntwana (i-UNCRC) yamkelwa yaza yaqalisa ukusebenza kunyaka olandelayo. UMzantsi Afrika utyikitye iSivumelwano kwishumi elinesithoba elinamashumi alithoba anesithathu waza wasiqinisekisa kwishumi elinesithoba elinamashumi alithoba anesithandathu. Inqaku lesithathu leNgqungquthela lithetha ngokuthe ngqo ngeyona nto ilunge kakhulu emntwaneni, lichaza ukuba kufuneka libe yingqwalasela ephambili kuzo zonke izenzo eziphathelele abantwana.

Le Ngqungquthela ikwaqaphela ukubaluleka kosapho njengeqela elisisiseko lentlalontle kunye nokusingqongileyo kwendalo ukuze abantwana bakhule kwaye baphumelele. Igxininisa imfuneko yokuba intsapho ifumane inkxaso efunekayo ukuze iphumeze iimbopheleleko zayo ekuhlaleni.

Ngenxa yemiba elijongene nayo iSebe leMfundo esiSiseko (DBE), akucaci ukuba nabani na unokuphikisa ngelithi ukufunda okusesikweni yeyona ndlela ifanelekileyo yomntwana, ngakumbi xa kukho ezinye iindlela ezizezinye ezifumanekayo. Izalathi ezahlukeneyo zibonisa ukuba isebe liyasilela nakwisigunyaziso salo esisisiseko sokufundisa ukufunda nokubhala nokubala okusisiseko.

Ngako oko, urhulumente, nge-DBE, wohlulekile ukwenza okona kulungileyo komntwana njengoko ifunwa yi-UNCRC.

Okungundoqo kuko konke oku kukuqondwa ukuba wonke umntwana unamalungelo asisiseko, kuquka ilungelo lokuphila, ukuphila, nokukhula; ukukhuselwa kubundlobongela, ukuxhatshazwa, okanye ukungahoywa; imfundo ebenza bafikelele kwisakhono sabo esipheleleyo; ukukwazi ukuba nobudlelwane nabazali bobabini, nokuba bahlukene; ilungelo lokuvakalisa izimvo zabo nokuviwa; ukukhuselwa kwemfihlo yabo; kunye nesiqinisekiso sokuba ubomi babo abuphazanyiswa ngokugqithisileyo.

6.3. Yintoni imfundo esisiseko?

Oosopolitiki noonobuhle borhulumente balahlekise abazali ukuba bacinge ukuba imfundo yasesikolweni yeyona ndlela yokufundisa abantwana babo, kwaye iSebe leMfundo esiSiseko libandakanyeke koku. Kuyaxhalabisa ukubonakaliswa kwenkcaso njengento engekho mthethweni kunye neenzame zokungakhuthazi ezinye iindlela zemfundo, ngakumbi xa kujongwa imeko embi yenkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo.
Inkcazo yesikolo njengesikolo esimiselweyo emthethweni iyaphikisana noMgaqo-siseko, othatha indlela esekelwe ukwanela ekuchazeni imfundo esisiseko. Abazali bangundoqo ekuchazeni imfundo esisiseko, yaye amaziko ahlukahlukeneyo nabantu ngabanye, kuquka abaqulunqi bomthetho, abaqulunqi bomgaqo-nkqubo, ootitshala, abafundi nemibutho yasekuhlaleni, bafak’ isandla ekuxonxeni ukuqonda nokusetyenziswa kwelungelo lemfundo esisiseko. Ukulichaza eli lungelo ekugqibeleni ngumzamo wedemokhrasi nentsebenziswano.

6.4. Amanye amazwe kunye nembono yehlabathi.

Kumazwe apho imfundo isinyanzeliso, ibethelelwa kowona mthetho uphakamileyo wawo. Imfundo yasekhaya isemthethweni kwamanye amazwe amaninzi, njengoko igutyungelwe kakhulu ngabafundi baseKhaya baseMzantsi Afrika.

UMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika uyayiqonda indima ebalulekileyo yabazali kwimfundo yomntwana wabo. Ngoko ke, iqinisekisa ukuba isikolo esisisinyanzelo asikuphela kwendlela yokubonelela ngemfundo esisiseko. Amanye amacandelo oMgaqo-siseko nawo akhusela kwaye akhuthaze indima ebalulekileyo yabazali neentsapho.
7. Indawo yokusukela.

Ndacinga ngamava am kwizikolo zikarhulumente xa ndithatha isigqibo sokuba imfundo yasekhaya ilungile na ebantwaneni bam. Ndandidla ngokucinga ukuba impumelelo yam ebomini yayibangelwa yimfundo yam yasesikolweni kuphela; nangona kunjalo, ukuba bekunjalo, ngoko wonke umntu oye wangena kwisikolo esifanayo ufanele afikelele kwinqanaba elifanayo lempumelelo ubuncinane.

Noko ke, xa ndathelekisa imiphumo yabantu abanemvelaphi efanayo yemfundo, ndaqonda ukuba impumelelo efanayo yayingeyonto iqhelekileyo kodwa yayingaqhelekanga. Enyanisweni, abantu abaninzi abaye bafumana impumelelo engathethekiyo ngokwezinto eziphathekayo babengenamfundo yasesikolweni kwiinkalo zabo.

Olu qwalaselo lwayicel’ umngeni inkolelo yokuba inkqubo yesikolo inempembelelo enkulu kumntu ngamnye. Abantu abaninzi abaphumeleleyo eMzantsi Afrika banemfundo encinane okanye abanayo kwaphela. Kwandicacela ukuba oyena ndoqo wempumelelo usekukwazini ukuqhubeka nomnombo wakhe nokubonelela isizukulwana esilandelayo.

Ifuthe lemfundo yasesikolweni, esele likho ixeshana elifutshane kuphela, libaxekile ngokugqithisileyo. Ndicinga ngokukhula kwam, apho abazali bam babeyibeke phambili imfundo kwaye bebonelela ngezixhobo zokufunda ekhaya, ndakubona ukubaluleka kwezi mpawu ndaza ndafuna ukuzandisa ngemfundo yasekhaya.
 
7.1. Imvelaphi yesikolo yabazali ngokuchasene nenkqubela phambili yesikolo.

Xa sikhethela abantwana bethu eyona ndlela ifanelekileyo yemfundo, bekubalulekile ukuba sithathele ingqalelo imvelaphi yemfundo kunye nezimbo zobuzali esathi zanikwa thina njengabazali, nendlela ezihambelana ngayo nenkqubela esiyenzileyo emva kokuphuma kwesikolo. Ukuhambelana kwezini, okuyimfuneko ekukhawulweni komntwana, kuhlala kubalulekile ngokulinganayo emva kokuba umntwana ezelwe. Ivumela abazali ukuba bathelekise kwaye bathelekise amava abo obuntwana kwaye baqonde ukuba babubumba njani ubudala babo.

Elona xesha lide, ngokuchaseneyo neemfundiso zesikolo ezisesikweni ngokufuthi zazigxininisa impembelelo yokukhulisa kwindalo, zingayikhathaleli impembelelo yemfuza. Kwakukholelwa ukuba imeko-bume yayigqiba ukuba ubani ungubani, nto leyo eyayifana neembono zikaJohn Broadus Watson.

Ukanti, eneneni, indima yemfuza ekubumbeni iimpawu zobuntu ayinakubethwa ngoyaba. Ngokucacileyo, ukubaluleka kwendalo ngaphezu kokukhuliswa kuye kwaphawulwa ziingcali ezahlukeneyo, ezifana noGqr Mark Leary kunye noSteven Pinker. Oku kubaluleke ngakumbi kuSazi, onokubona imiphumo yendalo kunye nokukhuliswa ngenxa yeemvelaphi ezifanayo zabazali bakhe.

Ngaphezu koko, iinzame zoluntu zokukhuthaza inkqubela phambili yabasetyhini zibe nkulu, zijolise ekupheliseni imiqobo ebithintela inkqubela yabo. Ngako oko, akufuneki kuphinde kubekho umkhethe okhetha ukuba amadoda aphumelele ngakumbi, okwenza kube lula ukuthelekisa iziphumo phakathi kwesini.

Indlela esikhule ngayo yayahlukile kangangokuba ngoku sinokuyivavanya impembelelo yayo ngokweziphumo zethu. Ukhulele edolophini eBhayi waya kwisikolo samabanga aphakamileyo esasigxininisa izithethe zobuKristu watshintsha nezikolo kanye. Ndikhulele emaphandleni aseTranskei, ndifunda kwizikolo zikarhulumente ngaphandle kweefizi, ndatshintsha izikolo izihlandlo ezihlanu, ndaza ndachitha iminyaka emine yokugqibela eMpumalanga, apho isikolo sasinelona zinga lisezantsi lokuphumelela imatriki kwisithili saso kumashumi amabini anesibini. I-alma mater kamama wonyana wam iphumelele ikhulu lepesenti. Koko, amashumi alithoba anesine amanqaku ebekufanele ukuba aqhube izifundo zesidanga ekholejini.

Ngenxa yokuba sikhulele kwiindawo ezahlukeneyo ngokupheleleyo, umntu unokulindela umahluko omkhulu phakathi kwethu njengabantu abadala. Kwaye eneneni, kukho umahluko omkhulu, nangona kungenjalo ngendlela umntu anokuyilindela ngayo. Ingcinga yokuba ukuya kwizikolo ezinezibonelelo ezingcono kuya kuqinisekisa iziphumo ezingcono icelwa umngeni zezona ziphumo. Oku kuqonda akuceli umngeni nje kuphela ukongama kwemveli yemfundo yeprayimari yemveli kodwa ikwagxininisa ukungasebenzi kokwenza utyalo-mali olongezelelekileyo kuyo ngaphaya kwexesha elithile.

Ukuqukumbela, ukuphononongwa kwemvelaphi yabazali, imfundo esemthethweni, kunye nempumelelo yobuqu isebenza njengesityhilelo, umngeni kwiinkolelo eziqhelekileyo kwaye igxininisa imida yokuchaza impumelelo ngeendlela eziphathekayo.

7.2. Ubuntu bomntwana kunye nabazali.

Ngelixa abantu abaninzi befumana ukonwabela ukuthatha inxaxheba kwimidlalo nakwimisetyenzana yokuzonwabisa esikolweni, mna, ngokobuqu, andizange ndibe nolwazelelelo olufanayo. Ndandingenamdla kwimidlalo yaye utyekelo lwam lokopha iimpumlo kwanangomsebenzi omncinane womzimba akuzange kuncede.

Ngaphandle kwemeko yesikolo, ndandingenamdla kangako wokuchitha ixesha nabanye abantwana, ngenxa yenkqubo engqongqo kamama. Ngoxa oontanga bam babenenkululeko yokudlala de kube sebusuku baze bazulazule ngaphandle kokuzibamba, ubomi bam basekhaya babahluke ngokupheleleyo. Silandele inkqubo engqongqo:
Vuka kwangentseni uye ngqo esikolweni.
Buyela ngqo ekhaya emva kweeklasi ngaphandle kokujikela.
Gqibezela yonke imisebenzi yasekhaya kwaye uqinisekise ukuba iyunifomu yangomso ilungisiwe, kuquka nezihlangu ezikhazimlisiweyo.
Dlala ngaphandle eyadini nabanye abantwana.
Buyela phambi kwentsimbi yesi-6 pm ukuqinisekisa ukuba isango alitshixwa.
Gqibezela umsebenzi wasekhaya ngaphambi kokulala.

Besingenamfuyo ekhaya. Oku kwakuthetha ukuba amathuba okonwaba ngoxa kusalusa iinkomo emadlelweni aphantse ukuba angabikho. Ebudeni beminyaka yam yeshumi elivisayo sasivuna amanzi emvula, sinciphisa imfuneko yokuya emlanjeni. Nangona kunjalo, oku kwakuthetha amathuba ambalwa okunxibelelana nabanye abantwana. Nasesikolweni samabanga aphakamileyo, ndaqhelana nendlela yabazali bam, ndikhetha ukuhlala kufutshane nekhaya kunokuba ndiphume phandle, nangona ndandifumana amathuba amatsha.

Njengomntu omdala, zimbalwa izinto ezindicaphukisayo njengabantu ababefanisa ukuba nobomi obanelisayo nokuphuma rhoqo. Ukuza kuthi ga namhlanje, ayikho enye indawo endingathanda ukuba kuyo ngaphandle kokuba sekhaya, nto leyo eye, ekuhambeni kwexesha, yaguquka yaba kungekuphela nje indawo yokuthuthuzela kodwa nendawo yam yokusebenza. Ngaphandle kwemiceli mngeni eziswe kukuvalwa okunyanzeliswa ngurhulumente ngokungekho sikweni kunye nemilinganiselo engenelelayo ngexesha lobhubhani we-Covid, ikwaveze izibonelelo ebezingalindelekanga. Enye yezi kukwanda kokusebenza kude nokufunda kude.

Abanye abaninzi baye balixabisa ikhaya njengendawo esisiseko yokusebenza nemfundo. Oku kuqinisekisa isigqibo sam sokulandela ikhondo elahlukileyo xa kuziwa kwimfundo yabantwana bam.

7.3. Imekobume yentsapho.

Ngaphambi kokuba izikolo zemveli zande, iintsapho zazidlala indima yemfundo. Iintsapho ezininzi zazihlala kunye kwindawo enye, enoomakhulu nootatomkhulu, abazali, oodadobawo, oomalume nezinye izalamane. Oku kwadala imekobume yenkxaso apho abantwana babenyanyekelwa ngoxa abantu abadala besebenza, yaye babefunda ubuchule obusebenzisekayo kumalungu entsapho.

Kwikhaya losapho, wonke umntu utyale imali kwimpumelelo yomntwana, ngokungafaniyo kwizikolo zikarhulumente okanye kwizikolo zabucala apho kugxininiswa kwinzuzo yemali. Ngelixa abanye benokuthi umvuzo ubalulekile kubafundisi-ntsapho, iingenelo zokufunda ekhaya ziquka ukomelezwa kwemilinganiselo yosapho.

Imfundo yasekhaya inokuba lucelomngeni kubazali abangenamaqabane okanye izibini ezizibophelelayo ngomsebenzi, njengoko kusenokufuna ukuqesha umntu oza kunyamekela umntwana aze afundise ekhaya. Oku kusenokubiza imali eninzi yaye kusenokungavisisani nenjongo yokubethelela imilinganiselo yentsapho. 

Nangona kunjalo, ukuba abazali basebenza ekhaya, imfundo yasekhaya iba yinto enokwenzeka ngakumbi kwaye ukuba nomzali okhoyo kunika imvakalelo yonqabiseko. Kwimeko yam, ukuba nomakhulu, oomakazi, kunye nam ekhaya kwandisa umthwalo kwaye kuvumele ukuba kwabelwane ngezakhono ezahlukeneyo.

Ndiyibonile impumelelo kamama ekukhuliseni amakhwenkwe kunye nendoda, kwaye ubuchule bakhe buxabisekile kum. Ngokufanayo, irekhodi likamama ngokukhulisa abasetyhini liyathetha

Ukuhlala kufutshane nosapho kubalulekile ukuze kusoloko kukho inkxaso. Kumava am, usapho luthembekile kwaye luluncedo ngamaxesha esidingo. Kwakhona kunciphisa usizi lokuhlukana nabazala kunye nokuqinisekisa ukuba unyana wam unonxibelelwano oluqinileyo kunye nosapho lwakhe.

Njengezibulo nendoda ekuphela kwayo, ndiziva ndinoxanduva lokuphumelela utata ndize ndinyamekele umama nabantakwethu. Nangona ndifundiswa esikolweni ukuba oku kuphelelwe lixesha, ndiyakholelwa ekubalulekeni kwemilinganiselo yosapho ngokusekelwe kumava am. Ngokugcina usapho lwam kunye nokubonelela imeko-bume efanelekileyo yokufunda ekhaya, ndiye ndabugcina ubulumko bukamama ndaza ndadala ikhaya apho unyana wam anokufunda khona.

7.4. Kungcono xa kukho ngaphezu komntwana omnye.

Kumava am, ndiye ndaphawula ukuba akukho nto inokuthatha indawo yokunxibelelana kwabantwana nokufunda koontanga babo. Izikolo ezisesikweni zinika abantwana ithuba lokunxulumana, lokukhuphisana, nokufunda omnye komnye. Ukuba bendifunda ekhaya umntwana wam ekuphela kwakhe, bendinokujongana nemiceli mngeni njengoko ebengayi kuba nonxibelelwano olufanayo noontanga bakhe.

Noko ke, ndiyambulela kuba engqongwe ngabazala bakhe abakwintanga enye. Bahlala bekunye kwaye bangaze badikwe okanye bangaphumli ekhaya. Bade bancedisane ekufundeni iikhonsepthi ezinzima ngendlela eyonwabisayo nangentsebenziswano. Kuyamangalisa ukubona ukuba izakhono zekhompyuter zikaMilande ziphucuka ngokukhawuleza kangakanani, ukuya kuthi ga kwinqanaba apho anceda abanye ngemicimbi yekhompyuter yabo.

Ukuba nomntu ofikisayo kumxube kuluncedo nako, njengokuba edlulisa izifundo esazifundisa kubazala bakhe nodade wabo. Phakathi kwabo, umtshana wam omncinane uzuza kakhulu ngokuba nabantwana abadadlana abaza kudlala nabo baze bamkhokele. Ukusekwa kwabantwana abaninzi kunye nabazali abaninzi kukwanceda ekuqeqesheni. 

Ngamanye amaxesha, kungakhathaliseki ukuba ndizama kangakanani na ukuba nonyana wam, andikwazi ukuxhathisa umtsalane wakhe ndize ekugqibeleni ndinikezele. Okuvuyisayo kukuba, xa umakhulu esithi "hayi," akukhathaliseki ukuba ndiye ndanikezela. Ngokufanayo, xa unyana akandonwabanga usoloko ekhona umntu apha efamilyni ozomphakamisa nokuba ngoo makazi bakhe, abazala okanye umakhulu wakhe.
Icandelo lesithathu: Siyenza njani ukuba isebenze.
8. IiMfuno zeHardware kunye neSoftware.

Enye yeenzuzo ezimbalwa zenkqubo yesikolo esesikweni kukuba inyamekela yonke imiba yamalungiselelo, ngoko abazali akufuneki bakhathazeke ngayo. Abazali banokukuphepha ukubandakanyeka kwimfundo yomntwana wabo, ingakumbi ukuba isikolo asisihle kangako. Izikolo kufuneka zamkele bonke abantwana, nkqu nakwizinto abazali ekufuneka bathathe inxaxheba kuzo. Abanakugxotha umntwana kuba befuna ukuthatha inxaxheba.

Abazali abanabantwana abakwinkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo badla ngokufuna kuphela ukuqinisekisa ukuba umntwana wabo uya esikolweni. Basenokukhetha ukuba nenxaxheba encinane kwindlela esisebenza ngayo isikolo. Urhulumente ngoku ulawula imfundo yasesikolweni, nto leyo eyahlukileyo kweyamandulo xa kwakusenziwa izikolo ngamalungu asekuhlaleni.

Xa abazali bonyana wam badibana, sasisele singabantu abazimeleyo. Sasingathembeli omnye komnye kwimisebenzi eyenziwayo efana nokupheka nokucoca. Ekuphela kokuxhomekeka kwethu kuthando lothando. Nangona kunjalo, uthando lwezithandani lulodwa alufane lwanele, ukuba lukhona, ukugcina ubudlelwane.

Ukubhalisa umntwana kwisikolo esimiselweyo kunokunciphisa ixesha lakhe nomnye umzali, ngakumbi xa abazali bengekho kunye. Ukufunda kude kunye nokufunda ekhaya kubonelela ngeendlela ezingcono zabantwana kwezi meko.

Imfundo yasekhaya ivumela ukuba bhetyebhetye kunye nethuba lokuba abantwana bafunde kumalungu entsapho. Ikwavumela ootata ukuba bachithe ixesha elingakumbi nabantwana babo, njengoko banokuba neshedyuli ebhetyebhetye ngakumbi kunoomama ngemini yobuhlanga kunye nesini emsebenzini. Ootata banendima ebalulekileyo ekulungiseleleni abantwana iingxaki zobomi.

Imidlalo kunye nokuzivocavoca kunokuba luncedo kumadoda njengendawo yokuthengisa. Nangona kunjalo, imidlalo yesikolo iye yancipha kakhulu kwaye igxininisa ngakumbi kukhuseleko, olunokuthi lube luncedo kumakhwenkwe nakumadoda.

Icandelo lesithandathu: Ekuvaleni, okwangoku.


16. Imfundo yasekhaya iyavakala, nakwabangabafundi basekhaya nakurhulumente.

Ngenyanga yeDwarha engamashumi amabini anesithathu, abemi boMzantsi Afrika babenokuninzi abakubhiyozelayo. Ngaphandle kokuphumelela embhoxweni, oyena nobangela uphawuleka kakhulu wokubhiyozelwa kukungaphazanyiswa kombane ovela kwa-Eskom, nto leyo ibiyinguqu entle ekucinyweni kombane rhoqo.

Ukuhamba kwezithuthi nako kuphuculwe ngenxa yezibane zendlela ezisebenzayo kunye nezibane zasezitalatweni. Ukongeza, abantu baye bafumana ukuzithemba ngakumbi ukuba iivenkile kunye neenkonzo ziya kuqhuba ngokuqikelelwa njengoko kufanelekile. Sekuyinto eqhelekileyo ukuba iindawo zivalwe ngesiquphe ngenxa yokucinywa kukagesi, nto leyo eshiya abathengi bexinezelekile. Ukonakaliswa kokutya bekungekho nto ixhalabisayo ngenxa yokucutheka kokumka kombane.

Ngaba olu phuculo lubangelwe kukutyumba kukamongameli umphathiswa wombane?

Hayi kufutshane!

16.1. Ityala elichasene nokubekwa kumbindi, ubonelelo ngoMbane njengomzekelo.

Abantu babucala eMzantsi Afrika bebethatha inyathelo lokunciphisa ukuthembela kwabo kwigridi yombane kwaye babhenele kwezinye iindlela zombane. Idatha ibonisa ukuba amakhaya kunye namashishini afake isixa esibalulekileyo sophahla lwe-PV yelanga.

Olu tshintsho kwimithombo yamandla yimpendulo ekucuthekeni kombane okuthe gqolo okwenzeka elizweni. Indlela urhulumente ajonga ngayo ukubonelela ngombane, u-Eskom njengoyedwa, ibe yingxaki ekuhlangabezaneni nemfuno eyandayo. Nangona kunjalo, abantu babucala abatyala imali kumandla elanga baye bakwazi ukubonelela ngombane kubo nakwabanye.

Oku bekuya kuba sisisombululo esifanelekileyo ekunciphiseni iindleko zokuhambisa umbane kwiindawo ezisemaphandleni apho amakhaya asasazeke ngokwahlukeneyo kunye nemithombo yamandla engenye efana neenkuni kunye nobulongwe benkomo isetyenziswa rhoqo. Imigaqo-nkqubo karhulumente kunye nokusilela ukujongana neemfuno zabahlali basemaphandleni kube negalelo kwintlupheko kwimimandla yasemaphandleni kunye nokufudukela kwiindawo ezidolophini.

Ukufakela iipaneli zelanga kuye kwaduma njengoko kuphucula ixabiso lepropati, kodwa oku akunakwenzeka kumhlaba wezizwe ngaphandle kwamalungelo afanelekileyo omhlaba. Uncedo lwangoku lokucuthwa kombane alubangelwa yimizamo karhulumente, kodwa izenzo zabantu babucala. Utyalo-mali lwabo lunceda bona kunye nabo bangenako ukuhlawula enye imithombo yamandla.

16.2. Ityala lemfundo yasekhaya, ukuze wonke umntu azuze.

Inkqubo yesikolo esesikweni ayikazalisekisi izithembiso zayo nangona ifumene inkxaso-mali ethe chatha.

Ukubonelela ngeendlela ezahlukeneyo zemfundo ezikhethwe ngabazali kunokunciphisa uxinzelelo kwinkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo. Oku kunokukhokelela kwiimeko ezingcono zemfundo kwabo bahlala kwizikolo ezimiselweyo. Iiklasi ezixineneyo zikhokelele ekwandeni kwefuthe elibi ebantwaneni. Ukufudukela ezidolophini notyalo-mali oluncinane kwiindawo ezisemaphandleni kunyanzela abantwana ukuba bahambe imigama emide ukuya esikolweni, nto leyo ebeka ubomi babo esichengeni.

Inkqubo yesikolo esesikweni inciphisa ubuchule kunye nokucinga okuphangaleleyo kumntu wonke. Imfundo yasesikolweni ineengenelo kwaye ifanele iqwalaselwe ukuthomalalisa umthwalo ebantwaneni nakwiintsapho. Le ndlela ibiya kuvumela abazali ukuba bachithe ixesha elingakumbi nabantwana babo, yaye abo bakhetha imfundo yasesikolweni banokuba neemeko ezilunge ngakumbi zokufunda.

Voorwoord.

Die idee van formele skoolopleiding het so ingeburger geraak in die samelewing dat sommige bereid is om dit deur wette te mandaat. Hierdie idee stel voor dat onderwysers, burokrate en politici oor ons kinders se opvoeding moet besluit in plaas van die ouers. Die BELA-wetsontwerp bedreig ouers se beheer oor hul kinders se opvoeding deur besluitnemingsmag meer gesentraliseerd te maak.
Politici maak hul besorgdheid oor kinders se welstand om stemme te kry. Akademici wat deur belastingbetalerstoelaes befonds word, bekragtig hierdie idees, en individue wat as kundiges en professionele persone aangestel word, vind baat deur die idees van die politici wat hulle dien, te propageer, insluitend deur die nasionale kurrikulum. Tradisionele waardes en die kennis wat deur generasies oorgedra word, word verontagsaam ten gunste van progressiewe idees.
Die gevolg?
Suid-Afrika in 2023, met hoë werkloosheid, misdaadsyfers en meer ontvangers van maatskaplike toelaes as belastingbetalers. Staatsdienste en staatsbeheerde entiteite misluk, skole en tersiêre instellings word geteister deur korrupsieskandale, en gesondheidsorg is onbetroubaar.
Die formele skoolstelsel het die land met talle maatskaplike euwels gelaat, al spog dit met die mees opgevoede generasie. Hierdie probleme is die gevolg van ondersteunende idees wat formele skoolopleiding bo ouerbetrokkenheid prioritiseer. Die stelsel het misluk, wat daartoe gelei het dat ek alternatiewe weë vir my kinders se opvoeding soek.
Ek erken dat my pad dalk nie vir almal werk nie, maar die arrogansie wat aanvaar dat formele onderwys geskik is vir almal, het aansienlike skade berokken. As positiewe uitkomste in volwassenheid nie hoofsaaklik as gevolg van formele skoolopleiding is nie, hoekom belê ons aansienlike tyd en geld daarin en gee ons gewillig kosbare tyd saam met ons kinders af?
Ek weier om my kinders aan 'n falende formele skoolstelsel te onderwerp, asof dit die enigste alternatief is. Ons stam almal af van voorvaders wat tot onlangs nog nooit hul kinders op formele wyse opgevoed het nie, maar eerder daarop gefokus het om hul kinders by die huis informeel te skool.

As ek dit erken, het ek alternatiewe geleenthede vir my gesin gesoek.
Deel 1, Hoekom?
Die formele skoolstelsel.

Tuisonderwys is 'n aloude metode om kinders op te voed. Dit gaan voor formele geïnstitusionaliseerde skoolopleiding in alle kulture en weerspieël 'n ouer se begeerte om hul kind se opvoeding persoonlik binne die gesinshuis te lei. Hierdie benadering verleen nie net die nodige kennis, vaardighede en waardes vir verdere onderwys, indiensneming en aktiewe gemeenskapslidmaatskap nie, maar dit bied ook buigsaamheid en toegang tot verskeie leerhulpbronne.
Die historiese konteks van onderwys in Suid-Afrika werp lig op die diepgewortelde tradisie dat gesinne en gemeenskappe die primêre opvoeders van kinders is, wat aan hulle noodsaaklike vaardighede verskaf vir oorlewing en gemeenskapsbydrae. Die verbintenis tot hierdie opvoeding is gedryf deur 'n opregte belangstelling om kinders met praktiese vaardighede toe te rus, wat weer tasbare gevolge vir die gesin en die breër gemeenskap gehad het. Selfs in die konteks van formele instellings en gestruktureerde opleiding bly die belangrikheid van informele onderwyspraktyke duidelik.
Die oorgang van informele onderwys na die instelling van formele skoolopleiding, aanvanklik deur sendingskole, het aanleiding gegee tot die uiteenlopende reeks onderwysinstellings wat vandag teenwoordig is. Die historiese en kulturele betekenis van tuisonderwys en informele onderwyspraktyke dien egter as 'n dwingende herinnering aan die diep verband tussen onderwys en gemeenskap, wat ver buite die grense van geïnstitusionaliseerde leer strek.

1.1. Openbare vs Privaatskole.
Die befondsing en eienaarskap bepaal of 'n skool publiek of privaat is. Openbare skole, of staatskole, kry die meeste van hul befondsing van belastingbetalers, terwyl privaatskole deur die ouers gefinansier word.
Openbare skole in laerinkomstegebiede is gratis en moet alle studente aanvaar, ongeag hul finansiële situasie of akademiese evaluasies. Kwantiel 5 openbare skole kan meeding met top private skole omdat hulle voldoende hulpbronne het uit die fooie wat hulle insamel.
Privaatskole funksioneer onafhanklik van die regering en kan voldoen aan spesifieke godsdienstige of opvoedkundige voorkeure. Premium-skole, wat verwys na beide privaatskole en premiebetalende kwantiel 5 openbare skole, beweer dat hulle voortreflike onderwys bied, maar vra hoër fooie.
Beide openbare en private skole poog om onderwys te verskaf, met die konvensionele model wat die bywoning van 'n fisiese fasiliteit met vasgestelde skedules en kurrikulum behels. Afstandsonderrig is 'n alternatief wat histories voordelig was vir werkende volwassenes wat hul opvoeding van 'n afstand wil bevorder, en die internet het hierdie benadering 'n rewolusie verander deur regstreekse bywoning in afgeleë klasse moontlik te maak, wat die leerproses meer toeganklik maak vir leerders van alle ouderdomme.

1.2. Formele skole vs afstandsonderrig vs tuisonderrig.
Dit is belangrik om te beklemtoon dat beide formele en aanlyn skole dieselfde opvoedkundige inhoud bied, wat slegs verskil in die manier waarop hulle dit lewer. Sommige openbare en private formele skole het verbaster om sommige van hul klasse aanlyn te gee, veral sedert die 2020-sluiting toe toegang tot skoolpersele beperk was.
Aanlynonderrig, ook bekend as afstandsonderrig, moet nie met tuisonderrig verwar word nie. Studente wat by die huis of enige ander plek leer, volg steeds die gevestigde skoolkurrikulum en hou by die skool se kalender en daaglikse skedule, met ouers wat 'n aktiewe rol speel, net soos in formele openbare of privaatskole.
Tuisonderrig is anders as 'n tuisskool, wat 'n formele onderwysmodel volg. In 'n tuisskool neem ouers die verantwoordelikheid van gradering en assessering op hulle, en aanvaar hierdie take in plaas van die onderwyser.
Tuisonderrig gee ouers 'n groter rol as die primêre opvoeders, wat meer buigsaamheid bied in terme van die kurrikulum. Aanlyn hulpbronne en kleinhandelaars verskaf die nodige materiaal, aangetekende of regstreekse klasse, en assesseringsinstrumente om ouers in hierdie rol te ondersteun.
Formele skole kry dikwels kritiek omdat hulle nie die unieke vermoëns van elke student erken nie as gevolg van hul gestandaardiseerde benadering. Dit is waar die eklektiese kurrikulum inkom. Hierdie persoonlike kurrikulum is hoogs buigsaam en gebruik verskeie onderrigmetodes om in die spesifieke behoeftes en belangstellings van elke kind te voorsien.
Die eklektiese kurrikulum erken dat ouers en familielede 'n intieme begrip van hul kinders het. Hulle unieke eienskappe maak hulle die ideale onderwysers vir sekere aktiwiteite, wat 'n persoonlike leerervaring skep. Net soos kinders fisiese eienskappe van hul ouers en familielede erf, erf hulle ook persoonlikheidseienskappe wat hul voorkeurleerstyle kan beïnvloed.
Aangesien ouers en familielede 'n kind se vermoëns kan assesseer op grond van hul opvoeding, genetika en hul eie vermoëns, behoort hulle 'n beduidende rol in die vorming van die kurrikulum te speel.
Hoekom ek begin het.

Suid-Afrika se onderwyskrisis is in 2023 weer aan die lig gebring, wat aan die lig gebring het dat meer as 80 persent van graad 4-leerlinge sukkel om te lees vir betekenis. Hierdie skokkende statistiek wat vrygestel is uit die 2021 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) eis dringende aandag. Die swak toestand van leesvermoë onder kinders wat belastingbefondsde openbare skole bywoon, het met reg uitgebreide mediadekking verdien, beide plaaslik en internasionaal. Die herhalende neiging van lae leesvaardigheid oor die jare kan nie geïgnoreer word nie, aangesien dit die dringende behoefte aan effektiewe en volhoubare oplossings om die land se onderwysstelsel te verbeter onderstreep. Dit is tyd dat die regering, veral die Minister van Basiese Onderwys, volle verantwoordelikheid neem en die aanhoudende kwessies aanspreek wat steeds die toekoms van Suid-Afrika se kinders beïnvloed.

2.1. Probleme met die formele skoolstelsel.
Die kwessies waarmee die formele skoolstelsel in Suid-Afrika te kampe het, is duidelik sonder dat dit nodig is om in akademiese navorsing te delf. Korrupsie is deurdringend, lei hulpbronne van skole af en bevoordeel individue. Boonop is die kwaliteit van infrastruktuur dikwels swak, met sommige geboue wat agteruitgaan voor voltooiing. Daarbenewens vererger maatskaplike uitdagings soos misdaad, stedelike migrasie en werkloosheid die onderwyssektor se stryd verder.
Hierdie kwessies het direkte gevolge vir die indiensneembaarheid van gegradueerdes, en Suid-Afrika se jeugwerkloosheidsyfer is verbysterend hoog. Die Departement van Hoër Onderwys het “gebrek aan leesbegrip” as die grootste vaardigheidstekort in die arbeidsmark geïdentifiseer. Ten spyte van die departement van basiese onderwys se visie vir 'n vooruitstrewende en demokratiese samelewing, is die werklikheid ver van hierdie ideaal.
Die belastingbefondsde formele skoolstelsel het belastingbetalershulpbronne misbruik en die samelewingsverdeeldheid voortgesit. Die verpligte aard van formele skoolopleiding is bereik deur wetgewende maneuvers, aangesien die Grondwet nie formele onderwys as die enigste manier om basiese onderwys te verskaf bepaal nie. Dit bevraagteken die legitimiteit om individue in 'n onderwysstelsel in te dwing.

2.2. Premium openbare skole en privaatskole is die oplossing, reg?
Die verspreiding van "raskonsultante" word hewig gekritiseer deur die Instituut vir Rasseverhoudinge (IRR), wat daarop gemik is om die praktyke van hierdie "jagters" te ontbloot. Opnames wat oor die afgelope twee dekades deur die IRR gedoen is, het aangedui dat rasverwante bekommernisse 'n klein persentasie van bekommernisse vir Suid-Afrikaners uitmaak, met kwessies soos werkloosheid, misdaad, lewensomstandighede en onderwys wat baie meer kommerwekkend is. Dit daag die heersende idee uit dat rassisme die grootste probleem is.
Die idee dat gesogte skole inherent beter is as openbare skole van laer gehalte, is ook twyfelagtig. Alhoewel elite-instellings blykbaar 'n beduidende voorsprong het in die aanbied van toponderrig, sal dit onbehoorlik wees om hul hoë slaagsyfers uitsluitlik aan hul prestasies toe te skryf. Dit is omdat hierdie instellings hul studente versigtig kies voor toelating en ook finansiële hindernisse oplê. Daarom is dit van kardinale belang om te erken dat hul sukses nie net na hul eie meriete geakkrediteer kan word nie.
Boonop het beskuldigings van rassediskriminasie teen gesogte skole tot duur ondersoeke gelei, wat uiteindelik nie bewyse lewer wat hierdie bewerings ondersteun nie. Daarbenewens word beide openbare en private onderwys geraak deur sosio-ekonomiese omstandighede en regstellendeaksiebeleide, met dalende meriete as die primêre kriteria vir aanstelling in beide sektore en 'n onvermoë om onbevoegde werknemers te beëindig as gevolg van regsgevolge.
Persoonlike ervaring weerspreek ook die idee dat die bywoning van gesogte skole sukses waarborg. Ten spyte van die bywoning van openbare skole met gebrekkige hulpbronne, het ek, saam met my maats, 'n vlak van sukses en lewenskwaliteit bereik wat die idee van gesogte skole as 'n absolute voordeel uitdaag.
Dit het my laat bevraagteken wat tot my sukses gelei het, al het ek na skole met swak hulpbronne gegaan? Hierdie prikkelende insigte daag konvensionele oortuigings oor raskwessies en die meerderwaardigheid van gesogte skole uit, en bied 'n dwingende perspektief op die ware faktore wat opvoedkundige en professionele sukses beïnvloed.
Maak die formele skoolstelsel ten minste sin?

As jy nog nooit konsepte verder ondersoek het as wat skole leer of in boeke buite die vereiste leeswerk verdiep het nie, dan mis jy die ware wese van die wêreld. Die meerderheid mense is eenvoudig geprogrammeer, nie werklik opgevoed nie, om Internasionale Hoofspreker en skrywer Nicky Verd te parafraseer.
As ek terugkyk op my eie ervaring, kan ek nou my ware gevoelens oor skool uitdruk. Ek het nooit as kind bevraagteken om skool toe te gaan nie. Dit was so natuurlik soos asemhaling of die lug en aarde, of so is ek geleer om te glo. Dit was 'n noodsaaklikheid vir oorlewing, iets waaroor jy nie 'n mening kon hê nie. Noudat ek egter die vryheid het om te bevraagteken en te besin, besef ek dat ek nie van skool gehou het nie. Ironies genoeg kan my akademiese rekords anders voorstel. Die waarheid is dat ek akademies uitgeblink het, want ek wou so vinnig as moontlik uit die grense van die skool ontsnap. Van kleins af het ek nog altyd meer op my gemak gevoel in die gerief van my eie huis. Dus, terwyl die skool 'n vorm van leer aangebied het, het dit dikwels soos 'n vorm van marteling gevoel.

3.1. Dinge wat nie sin maak van formele skoolopleiding nie.
Is die formele skoolonderwysmodel die beste vir diverse leerders? Toe ek grootgeword het, moes ek lang afstande skool toe stap, met harde weer en gevare in die gesig. Ek het meestal geleer deur na onderwysers te luister en modelantwoorde vir eksamens te kry. Kritiese denke is nie aangemoedig nie.
Sportaktiwiteite was verpligtend, al was dit nie geniet of nodig nie. Geweld was algemeen, ten spyte van oortuigings dat sport kan help om ons aggressiewe neigings as jong seuns te verdryf.
Skole is as primêre bronne van kindersorg gesien toe ouers gewerk het, maar as ons vandag se stygende werkloosheidsyfers in ag neem, hou dit nie meer water nie. In die verlede het baie gesinne op 'n enkele bron van inkomste staatgemaak, met een ouer wat by die huis gebly het om die kinders te versorg. Hierdie reëling was voordelig vir die welstand en ontwikkeling van die kinders.
In sekere gevalle, wanneer albei ouers verbind is tot formele diens, het onderwysers surrogaatversorgers geword. Ons sien nou die gevolge van minimale ouerbetrokkenheid en die uitdagings wat die generasie in die gesig staar wat baie op onderwysers staatgemaak het.

Die tyd wat ek saam met my ouers kon spandeer was beperk as gevolg van skool, wat vir my selfs moeiliker was, want my pa is oorlede toe ek 11 was. Ek moes die huis verlaat vir 'n beter opvoeding na sy dood. Dit het gemaak dat ek die onderwysstelsel beter wou verstaan, veral omdat ek voorberei het om my eie kinders te hê. Ek wou nie hê hulle moet deur dieselfde moeilike ervarings gaan nie. Die prestasie van skoolgegradueerdes na 1994 het die negatiewe impak van die onderwysstelsel getoon.

3.2. Ten minste voed die formele skoolstelsel mense op, nie waar nie?
As ons sou erken dat ons opvoedkundige reis ons identiteit vorm en ons toekoms bepaal, soos voorgestaan deur ondersteuners van formele skoolopleiding, sou dit impliseer dat individue wat hul skoolopleiding voltooi het, soos hoërskool, soortgelyke of ten minste vergelykbare uitkomste sal bereik, gegewe dat hulle dieselfde kurrikulum deurloop het. Mens kan aanvaar dat diegene wat minderbevoorregte openbare skole bygewoon het, 'n minimum vlak van prestasie sou hê, net soos diegene wat gesogte privaatskole bygewoon het, vergelykbare uitkomste aan die top sou hê.
Die werklikheid is egter ver van wat ons waarneem wanneer ons na werklike resultate kyk, veral in 'n positiewe rigting.
Terwyl skool 'n konsekwente deel van die lewe vir baie is, word die impak daarvan op 'n individu se sukses of mislukking dikwels oorskat. Dit mag logies wees om te dink dat individue wat soortgelyke skole bygewoon het soortgelyke of ten minste vergelykbare uitkomste sou hê, die waarheid is baie anders!
As formele skoolopleiding so 'n klein rol in mense se uitkomste speel, hoekom belê ons dan soveel tyd en hulpbronne daarin? Waarom offer ons kosbare oomblikke saam met ons kinders as ouers op, met die wete dat ons nooit daardie tyd kan herwin nie, net sodat hulle skool kan bywoon? Hoe en wanneer het ons hierdie manier van dink aangeneem?
In 2023 kan die situasie selfs meer kommerwekkend wees vir die "gebore vry" generasie. 'n Beduidende aantal individue uit die post-1994-era het nie net primêre en hoërskool suksesvol voltooi nie, maar het ook gekies om hoër onderwys op tersiêre vlak te volg. Dit behoort tot beter sukseskoerse te lei as vorige generasies met minder skoolopleiding, soos belowe deur formele skoolvoorstanders.
Die werklikheid is heeltemal die teenoorgestelde.
Hierdie generasie, ten spyte van meer jare van formele skoolopleiding, vaar eintlik slegter as hul voorgangers. Baie het aangewese geraak op belastingbefondsde ondersteuning en is vasgevang in 'n siklus van werkloosheid. Hulle het ewigdurende laste op belastingbetalers en hul eie ouers geword. As gevolg hiervan staar ouers onsekerheid oor hul oudag in die gesig, aangesien hulle langer moet werk of op hul aftree-inkomste moet staatmaak om vir beide hul kinders en kleinkinders te voorsien.
Historiese agtergrond van die formele onderwysstelsel.

Dit is belangrik om te erken dat praktyke soos godsdiens en opvoeding diep ingeburger is in ons kultuur, wat dit onbetwisbaar en heilig laat lyk. Tog, by nadere ondersoek, word dit duidelik dat hierdie praktyke beduidende en langdurige negatiewe gevolge kan hê.
In my strewe na kennis en begrip het ek 'n aansienlike deel van my vrye tyd daaraan gewy om my in boeke en dokumentêre films te verdiep wat lig op hierdie onderwerpe werp. Ek is beide geboei en verlig deur wat ek geleer het.
Alhoewel ek dalk nie altyd die studie van geskiedenis waardeer het nie, het ek begin om lief te wees vir die waardevolle insigte wat verkry is deur die verlede te ondersoek. Om die konteks van my familie se geskiedenis te ontdek en die geskiedenis van my gemeenskap en mensdom as 'n geheel te verken, het bewys dat dit ongelooflik relevant is om my toekoms te vorm. In die jaar drie-en-twintig voel ek bevoorreg om die geleentheid te hê om te delf in die boeiende werke van vroeë skrywers wat baanbrekerswerk gemaak het met die praktyk om rekords te dokumenteer en te bewaar.

4.1. Wanneer en waar het dit alles begin?
Die geskiedenis van die huidige skoolstelsel is groot en kompleks, maar ek sal die relevante aspekte aanraak. Om die invloedryke faktore te verstaan wat die onderwysstelsel gevorm het tot wat dit vandag is, is van kardinale belang. Dit het 'n gestandaardiseerde fabrieksmodel geword wat kreatiwiteit versmoor en individue wat voldoen aan die vereistes voortbring. Hierdie model is konsekwent nie net in die Weste nie, maar ook in Suid-Afrika.
Onderwys en godsdiens was nog altyd nou verbind. Die eerste formele skole kan teruggevoer word na drieduisend vC met die Sumeriërs en Egiptenare, wat studente leer lees en skryf. Teen duisend vC het godsdiensskole in Sirië die heilige Hebreeuse geskrifte onderrig, maar slegs die bevoorregte paar het toegang daartoe gehad. Confucius het die eerste skole vir almal geopen, nie net die elite nie.
Met die oorgang van jagter-versamelaars- na landbougemeenskappe het die vraag na onderwys gegroei. Kinders moes die vaardighede aanleer wat nodig is vir handearbeid in die landbou. Gehoorsaamheid en eerbied is beklemtoon, en ’n opstandige gees kan verskriklike gevolge hê. Die opkoms van die industriële era het die behoefte aan 'n inskiklike en gehoorsame arbeidsmag verder verhoog.

4.2. Outentieke begin tot onheilspellende teregstelling.
Formele onderwys is met goeie bedoelings gestig, met die doel om die samelewing te verbeter. Dit is egter mettertyd gemanipuleer en uitgebuit. Die formele skoolstelsel is geleidelik verwring deur individue wat persoonlike gewin soek, ten koste van die belastingbetalers wat kinders as pionne gebruik. Martin Luther, 'n Duitse priester, het 'n deurslaggewende rol gespeel in die implementering van verpligte skoolopleiding in Europa. Sy bedoeling was om die Bybel meer toeganklik vir gelowiges te maak deur te pleit vir openbare skoolopleiding.
Duitsland het in die sewentiende eeu wette aangeneem, wat onderwys verpligtend maak en deur die Lutherse kerk bedryf word. In die agtiende eeu het Duitsland 'n belastingbefondsde onderwysstelsel gehad, wat ander lande, insluitend die Verenigde State, beïnvloed het.
Nyweraars in Amerika het probeer om 'n arbeidsmag te skep wat gehoorsaam sou konformeer en nie die maghebbers bevraagteken nie. Private instellings soos die Algemene Onderwysraad, gefinansier deur ryk nyweraars soos John D. Rockefeller en Andrew Carnegie, het die onderwysstelsel volgens hul eie visies gevorm.
Regeringsbetrokkenheid by formele onderwys het toegeneem met die stigting van belastingbefondsde openbare skole. Teen die negentien dertigerjare het skoolbywoning verpligtend geword in Amerikaanse state. Die visie om individue te vorm om by die behoeftes van die samelewing te pas en intellektuele strewes te verontagsaam, het prominent geword.
Dit is ontmoedigend om te sien hoe inisiatiewe met edele bedoelings verdraai en verdraai kan word deur individue wat deur eiebelang gedryf word. Die formele skoolstelsel, bedoel om te bemagtig en te verlig, het dikwels die slagoffer van sulke magte geword.

4.3. Formele skoolopleiding in Suid-Afrika.
Volgens dr Hendrik Verwoerd, minister van naturellesake in die negentigerjare, het die naturelle-departement se onderwysbeleid die belangrikheid daarvan beklemtoon dat onderwys in die naturellegebiede en gemeenskappe van Suid-Afrika gewortel is. Dit was van kardinale belang om die Bantoemense te lei om hul eie gemeenskap te dien en selfversorgend te wees.
Die historiese ontwikkeling van die land se formele skoolstelsel weerspieël die uitdagings wat verskillende rassegroepe in die gesig staar. Hierdie historiese konteks werp lig op die kompleksiteite en stryd van die Suid-Afrikaanse onderwysstelsel.
Van toe die eerste formele skole deur die Nederlandse Kaapkolonie bekendgestel is tot die betrokkenheid van die Christelike kerk en die geleidelike verskuiwing van beheer van godsdienstige entiteite na die staat demonstreer die veranderende dinamika van onderwys.
Historiese invloede het ongetwyfeld formele onderwys as 'n sosiale standaard gevorm en verstewig, maar die vordering wat behaal is, is ondermyn deur ekonomiese, sosiale en politieke kragte sonde
Die werklike doel van die formele onderwysstelsel, soos gemeet aan werklike resultate.

Sedert negentien vier en negentig het Suid-Afrika 'n hoogs opgeleide generasie sien ontstaan, maar die resultate van hierdie verhoogde skoolopleiding het nie gelei tot die verwagte verbeterings in die land nie. Ten spyte van hoër inskrywingskoerse en 'n klem op formele onderwys, het die land se prestasie op belangrike gebiede soos werkloosheid, misdaadsyfers en ekonomiese groei nie voldoen aan die beloftes wat aan belastingbetalers en ouers gemaak is nie.
Die onderwysstelsel het nie daarin geslaag om gegradueerdes met praktiese vaardighede toe te rus nie, wat gelei het tot 'n verontagsaming van handearbeid en 'n gebrek aan belangstelling in praktiese ambagte. Die ontkoppeling tussen formele onderwys en werklike vermoëns word ook gesien in die gebrek aan funksie binne regeringsentiteite wat deur gegradueerdes beman word, van wie baie 'n geneigdheid tot korrupsie eerder as doeltreffende dienslewering getoon het.
Die politieke landskap is deur skandale en ondoeltreffendheid bederf, wat die doeltreffendheid van die land se onderwysstelsel om verantwoordelike, bevoegde burgers te produseer, bevraagteken. Gevolglik bevind Suid-Afrika hom in 'n moeilike posisie, met die gevolge van sosialistiese beleid en regstellende aksie wat die situasie verder vererger.
In die lig van hierdie realiteite is dit van kardinale belang om die ware uitkomste van die formele onderwysstelsel te evalueer en te bevraagteken wat dit werklik bereik het.

5.1. Plunder en korrupsie.
Die begrotingsoorsig van een-en-twintig deur die Nasionale Tesourie onthul dat die land se toekenning vir leer en kultuur na verwagting aansienlik sal groei oor die volgende paar jaar. Die Departement van Basiese Onderwys (DBO) ontvang die grootste toekenning uit alle departemente, 'n verbysterende som van 255,1 miljard Rand. Dit is egter duidelik dat hierdie belastingbetalersfondse vir persoonlike gewin deur die regerende party uitgebuit is.
Die skepping van bykomende ministeriële poste in tien en twintig binne die onderwysdepartement het tot verhoogde koste vir die belastingbetaler gelei, wat lojale partylede bevoordeel het. Die regering se regverdiging vir hierdie skeuring was om dienslewering en doeltreffendheid te verbeter. Die resultate was egter ver van bevredigend.
Die departement van basiese onderwys het onreëlmatige uitgawes ten bedrae van een punt vier miljard Rand aangegaan, en die Minister van Hoër Onderwys, wat sy pos sedert tien-en-twintig beklee, het nie noemenswaardige verbetering in sy portefeulje getoon nie. Die korrupsie en patronaatskap strek verder as interne aanstellings, met tenders wat op politieke verbintenisse eerder as prys of kwaliteit toegeken word.
Hierdie kultuur van korrupsie het die onderwysstelsel deurgedring, met berigte van hulpbronwanaanwending, wanadministrasie en misbruik van gesag in skole.
Selfs instellings met 'n gewaardeerde geskiedenis, soos UNISA en Fort Hare, is deur korrupsiebewerings geteister. Die gevolge van hierdie korrupsie is erg, met lewens wat geraak word en selfs verlore gaan. Die aantal geboortes onder meisies tussen die ouderdomme van tien tot negentien, van wie sommige bevrug is deur onderwysers en skoolhoofde wat hul mag misbruik het, is kommerwekkend.
Dit is duidelik dat die onderwysbegroting vir persoonlike gewin misbruik is, wat die vooruitgang van die land ondermyn. Hierdie doelbewuste uitbuiting van belastingbetalersfondse tot voordeel van die regerende party is 'n verraad van die Grondwet en die mense van die nasie. Die ware doel van die skoolstelsel was nooit om die land as geheel te bevoordeel nie, maar eerder om die belange van die regerende party te dien.
Die formele onderwysstelsel was 'n baie doeltreffende instrument vir politici om die land tot spyt te plunder.

5.2. Verseker volhoubare stembasis.
Die versekering van 'n volhoubare stembasis is van kardinale belang vir politieke partye, veral dié aan die linkerkant wat staatmaak op beloftes van vrye pryse en regeringsbystand om stemme te verseker. Hierdie strategie is egter nie volhoubaar op die lang termyn nie, aangesien mense bewus word van die nie-lewering van hierdie beloftes en kennis opdoen oor libertariese beleide wat persoonlike verantwoordelikheid en vryheid bevorder. Om mag te behou, moet die regerende party effektiewe strategieë vind om hul voortgesette oorheersing te verseker.
Een effektiewe strategie lê binne die skoolstelsel. In teenstelling met die algemene opvatting, is die swak gehalte van onderwys nie bloot te wyte aan onbevoegdheid nie, maar eerder 'n doelbewuste poging van die regerende party om die stelsel te ondermyn. Deur gegradueerdes te verhoed om voldoende kennis en vaardighede op te doen, kan die regerende party hul misleiding handhaaf en die massas deur propaganda manipuleer. Hierdie indoktrinasie begin op 'n jong ouderdom, waar studente geleer word om ander te blameer vir die regering se mislukking en beleid te aanvaar wat gelykheid bevorder deur hoë belasting en rasseverdeling.
Die regering verseker ook dat individue afhanklik word van maatskaplike bystand, wat 'n afhanklikheid van die regerende party skep vir hul lewensbestaan. Hierdie toelaes, hoewel aanvanklik as tydelik ingestel, laat dit selde toeontvangers om los te kom van hul afhanklikheid. Deur individue op die regering afhanklik te hou, kry die regerende party lewenslange ondersteuners wat sal aanhou om vir hulle te stem, wat verseker dat hulle aan bewind bly.
Die formele skoolstelsel speel 'n deurslaggewende rol in hierdie strategie. Despotiese regerings prioritiseer en maak onderwys verpligtend om burgers te indoktrineer en hul lojaliteit te verseker. Die hard-linkse ideologie wat die ondergang van die Weste versnel het en die mensdom se toekoms bedreig, is verskans deur formele onderwys, met voortdurende herhaling van valse narratiewe en half-wit ideologieë. Dit is kommerwekkend dat die mees geradikaliseerde individue dikwels gegradueerdes van gesogte instellings is, wat beter behoort te weet, maar ander aktief uitbuit. Selfs verdelende en vernietigende bewegings soos Black Lives Matter, wat deur politici omhels word, is gelei deur individue wat by 'n gegoede onderwys baat gevind het.
Dit is nie toevallig dat die meeste kollege professore as liberaal identifiseer nie, aangesien hulle 'n sleutelrol speel in die radikalisering van gegradueerdes en die verdraaiing van natuurlike waarhede. Die wedersydse verhouding tussen politici, staatsamptenare en intellektuele hou hierdie indoktrinasie verder voort. Politici is afhanklik van intellektuele om geloofwaardigheid aan linkse beleid te gee, terwyl intellektuele beloon word met toelaes wat deur belastingbetalers befonds word en ander geleenthede vir selfverryking.
Oor die algemeen is die onderwysstelsel 'n kragtige instrument om afhanklikheid te skep en burgers te breinspoel.

5.3. Verswakking van die invloed van ouers.
My ouers het altyd geglo in die belangrikheid van onderwys, hoewel hulle dit gelyk gestel het aan formele skoolopleiding. Ek het dit geniet om as kind te leer en het gesien hoe onderwys my pa gehelp het om vir ons gesin te voorsien.
Ek het egter begin bevraagteken waarom sommige kinders dit weerstaan het om skool toe te gaan. Daar was ouers wat sterk weerstand gebied het en hul kommer uitgespreek het oor skool wat hul kinders van waardevolle leerervarings in die regte wêreld ontneem. Dit is toe dat ek besef het dat die regering kinders wettiglik dwing om skool by te woon, wat my verwar het. As skoolgaan so voordelig is, hoekom is dit nodig om dit verpligtend te maak?
Hoekom sal 'n mens gedwing moet word om te doen wat goed is vir hulle? Geen wette is ooit vereis om mense te dwing om te eet of asem te haal nie; alle lewende entiteite weet dit instinktief en doen dit. Eerder as wat mense mors omdat hulle nie eet nie, is vetsug 'n probleem in welvarende lande. Wette word uitgevaardig om die eet van sekere kosse te beperk omdat alle lewende entiteite weet dat voeding nodig is, soek dit dus altyd.
Die regering se klem op verpligte onderwys het gelei tot 'n vermindering van ouerlike beheer oor hul kinders, wat van die begin af die beoogde doelwit was.
Daar was geen groter instrument om hierdie verswakking van die ouer se gesag te fasiliteer as die skoolstelsel nie. Die situasie het uiters kommerwekkend geword, met ondersteuners van die onderwysstelsel wat gepleit het dat kinders op 'n jonger ouderdom begin skoolgaan. Daar word dikwels aan ouers gesê dat vroeë kinderopvoeding voordelig is omdat dit hulle toelaat om te werk terwyl hul kind leer.
Studies en praktiese waarneming het getoon dat die voordele van vroeë kinderonderwys nie net 'n vlugtige impak het nie, maar ook werklike nadelige gevolge vir beide die kind en ouers het.

5.4. Die betekenis van gemeenskap in die gesinskonteks.
Vandag word die konsep van "gemeenskap" dikwels verkeerd geïnterpreteer en gebruik om individue te dwing om die laste wat met openbare onderwys verband hou, te dra. Daarom word dit noodsaaklik om 'n duidelike definisie te vestig van wat werklik 'n gemeenskap uitmaak. Laat ek dit illustreer deur voorbeelde uit my eie dorpie en familie te deel.
Ek is gebore in Fort Malan, 'n plattelandse dorpie wat sowat tien kilometer van die Oos-Kaapse kus geleë is. In hierdie dorpie was die huise van my naaste familielede in die nabyheid geleë, met verwantskapsbande wat afgeneem het namate die afstand toegeneem het. Hierdie patroon word weerspieël in my pa se dorpie, Nqabane, waar onmiddellike familielede ook in die nabyheid woon.
Toe ek grootgeword het, wanneer ek hierdie dorpies besoek het, het ek 'n sterk band met die mense gevoel as gevolg van ons gedeelde familiebande. Hierdie verbindings het 'n diep gevoel van behoort by my ingeboesem. Hierdie sterk gevoel van gemeenskap het gespruit uit die histories lae toestroming van buitestaanders en die algemene praktyk van ondertrouery binne die dorpe. Gevolglik het elke ouer in die gemeenskap 'n gevestigde belang gevoel in die welsyn van alle kinders, saamgebind deur verwantskapsbande.
Hierdie verenigde gemeenskap het saamgewerk en in 'n gemeenskaplike doelwit belê. Die samestelling van hierdie gemeenskappe het relatief stabiel gebly, met min eksterne individue wat aangesluit het. Hierdie gevoel van stabiliteit het vertroue by die “beleggers” ingeboesem dat hul toekomstige geslagte ook die vrugte daarvan sal pluk.
Die eerste skole wat ek bygewoon het, is hoofsaaklik gebou deur die kollektiewe pogings van die gemeenskap. Ouers het hul hulpbronne saamgevoeg en gebou om te bou wat die regering nie kon nie.
Ten spyte van die beperkte finansiële hulpbronne, was die gemeenskap baie trots daarop om saam te werk en te bereik wat hulle kon. Ek onthou nie gevalle waar individue opsetlik skooleiendom beskadig het omdat hulle ook iets sou benadeel wat hulle help bou het nie, en hulle was verwant aan iemand wat deur die skade geraak sou word.

Hierdie gemeenskappe was hewig aanmekaar en toegewy aan gedeelde doelwitte, gedryf deur hul jarelange vertroudheid met mekaar oor generasies heen en die beperkte beweging van mense in en uit die dorpe.
Dieselfde definisie van gemeenskap kan nie op huidige tye toegepas word nie, veral op nasionale skaal, wat nog te sê internasionaal.
In die lig van hierdie veranderinge word dit onrealisties om van individue te verwag om vreemdelinge te help wat hulle nie ken nie en waarskynlik nooit sal teëkom nie. Hierdie vreemdelinge kan óf vriende óf vyande wees, wat dit vir hulle moeilik maak om in nuwe dorpies aanvaar te word.
Deel 2: Waar ek begin het.

Tuisonderrig en die Reg, Die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet.

Die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet is die hoogste reg van die land, enige wet wat daarmee strydig is, is ongeldig. Dit waarborg die reg op basiese onderwys vir almal. Die Grondwet definieer nie wat as basiese onderwys kwalifiseer nie, en laat dit aan ouers en wettige voogde oor om te besluit.
Die staat moet hierdie reg implementeer deur redelike maatreëls te gebruik, en indien hierdie maatreëls as onredelik bevind word, geld die Grondwet. Die Grondwet erken ook die ouers en familie as die primêre versorgers vir kinders en laat slegs alternatiewe sorg toe as daar wettige redes is om te glo dat dit nodig is.
As ouer het ek die reg om beswaar te maak teen formele skoolopleiding as dit inmeng met my verantwoordelikheid om vir my kind te sorg. Dit is moeilik om te regverdig om kinders van hul ouers weg te neem en hulle deur vreemdelinge te laat onderrig en versorg, tensy die ouers en familie as 'n gevaar vir die kind verklaar is.

6.1. Oortree ek die wet deur nie my kind na 'n formele skool te stuur nie?
Absoluut nie. Die reg op tuisskool word deur die Grondwet beskerm en die Schneider-saak het dit duidelik gemaak dat nie-nakoming van spesifieke wetgewing nie as 'n oortreding beskou sal word nie.
Dit laat vrae ontstaan oor die departement van basiese onderwys se gesag om tuisonderrig te reguleer. Die Suid-Afrikaanse Skolewet vereis byvoorbeeld formele skoolbywoning vanaf die ouderdom van 7 tot 15 en lê boetes of gevangenisstraf op vir nie-nakoming. Artikel 51 vereis ook dat ouers tuisonderrig kinders moet registreer.
Die regerende party en sy bondgenote poog om die Wysigingswetsontwerp op Basiese Onderwyswette deur te voer, wat daarop gemik is om kinders in 'n mislukte formele onderwysstelsel te druk. Hierdie wetsontwerp het teenstand gekry van verskeie groepe, insluitend AfriForum en die Instituut vir Rasseverhoudinge (IRV), wat aanvoer dat dit mag in die staat se hande sentraliseer en gemeenskapsbetrokkenheid by skole ondermyn. Baie ouers, saam met organisasies soos die Pestalozzi Trust, staan op teen hierdie wetsontwerp. Opposisiepartye soos Vryheidsfront Plus (VF+), die African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) en die Demokratiese Alliansie (DA) het ook sterk teenkanting uitgespreek.
Die regering was meedoënloos in sy pogings om tuisonderrig te ontmoedig, maar ouers en voorspraakgroepe veg terug. Onderwysbeamptes in KZN het dit selfs vir ouers moeilik gemaak om vir tuisonderrig te registreer, wat die Pestalozzi Trust aangespoor het om regstappe te neem.

6.2. Tuisonderrig en die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet.
Alhoewel Artikel 29 aanvanklik mag lyk na die mees relevante afdeling om tuisonderrig in Suid-Afrika te verken, is dit eintlik Artikel 28 van die Grondwet wat die grootste belang het. Hierdie afdeling vestig die toon en dien as 'n rigtinggewende beginsel, wat die welstand en beste belange van die kind vooropstel in alle sake rakende hulle.
In November 1989 is die Verenigde Nasies se Konvensie oor die Regte van die Kind (UNCRC) aanvaar en het die volgende jaar in werking getree. Suid-Afrika het die Konvensie in 1993 onderteken en dit in 1996 bekragtig. Artikel 3 van die Konvensie spreek spesifiek die beste belange van die kind aan en bepaal dat dit 'n primêre oorweging moet wees in alle aksies rakende kinders.
Die Konvensie erken ook die belangrikheid van die gesin as die fundamentele sosiale groep en die natuurlike omgewing vir kinders om te groei en te floreer. Dit beklemtoon die noodsaaklikheid dat die gesin die nodige ondersteuning moet ontvang om sy verantwoordelikhede binne die gemeenskap na te kom.
Gegewe die kwessies waarmee die Departement van Basiese Onderwys (DBO) te kampe het, is dit onduidelik hoe enigiemand kan redeneer dat formele skoolopleiding die beste opsie vir 'n kind is, veral wanneer daar voortreflike alternatiewe beskikbaar is. Verskeie aanwysers toon dat die departement misluk selfs in sy basiese mandaat om basiese geletterdheid en syfervaardigheid te onderrig.
Gevolglik het die regering, deur die DBO, versuim om in die beste belang van die kind op te tree soos vereis deur die UNCRC.
Sentraal tot dit alles is die erkenning dat elke kind fundamentele regte het, insluitend die reg op lewe, oorlewing en ontwikkeling; beskerming teen geweld, mishandeling of verwaarlosing; 'n opvoeding wat hulle in staat stel om hul volle potensiaal te bereik; die vermoë om 'n verhouding met beide ouers te hê, selfs al is hulle geskei; die reg om hul menings uit te spreek en gehoor te word; die beskerming van hul privaatheid; en die versekering dat hulle nie buitensporig ingemeng word nie.

6.3. Wat is basiese onderwys?
Politici en staatmakers het ouers mislei om te dink dat formele skoolopleiding die enigste opsie is om hul kinders op te voed, en die departement van basiese onderwys is aandadig hieraan. Die uitbeelding van onenigheid as onwettig en pogings om alternatiewe onderwysmetodes te ontmoedig is kommerwekkend, veral in die lig van die treurige toestand van die formele skoolstelsel.
Die definisie van skool as formele skoolonderrig in wetgewing is in stryd met die Grondwet, wat 'n toereikendheidgebaseerde benadering tot die definisie van basiese onderwys volg. Ouers is die sleutel in die definisie van basiese onderwys, en verskeie instellings en individue, insluitend wetgewers, beleidmakers, onderwysers, leerders en gemeenskapsorganisasies, dra by tot die vorming van die begrip en toepassing van die reg op 'n basiese onderwys. Om hierdie reg te definieer is uiteindelik 'n demokratiese en samewerkende poging.

6.4. Ander lande en die internasionale perspektief.
In lande waar verpligte onderwys afgedwing word, is dit in hul hoogste wet vasgelê. Tuisonderrig is wettig in baie ander lande, soos breedvoerig gedek deur SA Tuisskolers.
Die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet erken die deurslaggewende rol van ouers in hul kind se opvoeding. Daarom verseker dit dat verpligte skoolopleiding nie die enigste manier is om basiese onderwys te verskaf nie. Ander afdelings van die Grondwet beskerm en bevorder ook die belangrike rol van ouers en gesinne.
Vertrekpunt.
Ek het aan my eie ervaring in openbare skole gedink toe ek besluit het of tuisonderrig reg is vir my kinders. Ek het vroeër gedink dat my sukses in die lewe uitsluitlik te danke was aan my formele opleiding; as dit egter die geval was, dan behoort almal wat soortgelyke skoolopleiding deurgemaak het ten minste dieselfde vlak van sukses te behaal.
Toe ek egter die uitkomste vergelyk van individue wat soortgelyke opvoedkundige agtergronde gehad het, het ek besef dat soortgelyke sukses nie die norm was nie, maar die uitsondering. Trouens, baie individue wat buitengewone materiële sukses behaal het, het nie formele opleiding in hul onderskeie velde gehad nie.
Hierdie waarneming het die oortuiging dat die skoolstelsel 'n beduidende invloed op individue gehad het, uitgedaag. Baie suksesvolle mense in Suid-Afrika het min of geen formele opleiding gehad nie. Dit het vir my duidelik geword dat die fundamentele essensie van sukses lê in die vermoë om 'n mens se geslagslyn voort te sit en vir die volgende geslag te voorsien.
Die impak van formele skoolopleiding, wat net vir 'n relatief kort tydperk bestaan, word erg oorskat. Deur na te dink oor my eie opvoeding, waar my ouers onderwys geprioritiseer het en leerhulpbronne by die huis verskaf het, het ek die belangrikheid van hierdie eienskappe besef en wou dit deur tuisonderrig versterk. 

7.1. Skool agtergrond van die ouers versus naskoolse vordering.
By die keuse van die optimale onderwysopsies vir ons kinders, was dit van kardinale belang om die opvoedkundige agtergrond en ouerskapstyle wat aan ons as ouers oorgedra is, in ag te neem, en hoe dit ooreenstem met die vordering wat ons na skool bereik het. Die komplementariteit van die geslagte, noodsaaklik vir kinderbevrugting, bly ewe belangrik nadat die kind gebore is. Dit stel ouers in staat om hul eie kinderervarings te vergelyk en te kontrasteer en te verstaan hoe hulle hul volwassenheid gevorm het.
Vir die langste tyd, in teenstelling met die werklikheid, het formele skoolleringe dikwels die invloed van koestering op die natuur beklemtoon, sonder om die impak van genetika te verontagsaam. Daar is geglo dat die omgewing 'n mens se identiteit bepaal het, wat John Broadus Watson se standpunte weerspieël.
Tog kan die rol van genetika in die vorming van persoonlikheidseienskappe in werklikheid nie misgekyk word nie. Opmerklik is dat die belangrikheid van die natuur benewens koestering deur verskeie kundiges uitgelig is, soos dr. Mark Leary en Steven Pinker. Dit is veral relevant vir Sazi, wat die uitwerking van beide die natuur en koestering kan aanskou as gevolg van die vergelykbare agtergronde van sy ouers.
Boonop was maatskaplike pogings om vroue se vooruitgang te bevorder aansienlik, met die doel om hindernisse uit te skakel wat hul vooruitgang belemmer het. Gevolglik behoort daar nie meer 'n vooroordeel te wees wat bevoordeel dat mans meer suksesvol is nie, wat dit haalbaar maak om uitkomste tussen geslagte te vergelyk.
Ons opvoeding was so anders dat ons nou die impak daarvan kan evalueer op grond van ons uitkomste. Sy het grootgeword in stedelike Port Elizabeth het na 'n premium skool gegaan wat Christelike waardes beklemtoon het en een keer van skool verander. Ek het in Transkei op die platteland grootgeword, openbare skole sonder fooie bygewoon, 5 keer van skool verander en die laaste 4 jaar in Mpumalanga deurgebring, waar die skool die laagste matriekslaagsyfer in sy distrik in 2022 gehad het. My seun se ma se alma mater het 'n slaagsyfer gehad. koers van 100%. Daaruit het 94,6% gekwalifiseer om graadkursusse aan die universiteit te volg.
Gegewe dat ons in heeltemal verskillende omgewings grootgeword het, sou 'n mens 'n beduidende verskil tussen ons as volwassenes verwag. En inderdaad, daar is 'n beduidende verskil, hoewel nie in die manier waarop 'n mens sou verwag nie. Die aanname dat die bywoning van skole met beter hulpbronne beter uitkomste sal waarborg, word deur die werklike resultate uitgedaag. Hierdie besef daag nie net die inherente meerderwaardigheid van tradisionele premie-skoolopleiding uit nie, maar onderstreep ook die ondoeltreffendheid daarvan om aansienlike bykomende beleggings verder as 'n sekere punt daarin te maak.
Ten slotte, die verkenning van oueragtergronde, formele opvoeding en persoonlike prestasies dien as 'n openbaring, wat konvensionele oortuigings uitdaag en die beperkinge van sukses met materiële middele beklemtoon.

7.2. Persoonlikheid van die kind en ouers.
Terwyl baie mense dit geniet om aan sport- en ontspanningsaktiwiteite by die skool deel te neem, het ek persoonlik nooit dieselfde entoesiasme gedeel nie. Ek het nie belangstelling in sport gehad nie en my neiging om neusbloeding te hê, selfs met die geringste fisiese inspanning, het nie gehelp nie.
Buiten die skoolomgewing het ek ook min begeerte gehad om tyd saam met ander kinders deur te bring, deels danksy my ma se streng roetine. Terwyl my maats die vryheid gehad het om tot laat te speel en sonder beperkinge rond te loop, was my huislewe heel anders. Ons het 'n streng roetine nagekom:
Word vroeg in die oggend wakker en gaan reguit skool toe.
Keer direk terug huis toe na klasse sonder ompaaie.
Voltooi alle huishoudelike pligte en maak seker dat môre se uniform voorberei is, insluitend gepoleerde skoene.
Speel buite in die tuin saam met ander kinders.
Keer terug voor 18:00 om te verseker dat die hek nie gesluit word nie.
Voltooi huiswerk voor slaaptyd.
Ons het geen vee by die huis gehad nie. Dit het beteken dat geleenthede vir sosialisering tydens die versorging van die koeie in die weiveld byna nie bestaan het nie. Gedurende my tienerjare het ons reënwater geoes, wat die behoefte om na die rivier te gaan verminder het. Dit het egter ook minder kanse beteken om met ander kinders om te gaan. Selfs op hoërskool het ek gewoond geraak aan my ouers se roetine, en verkies om naby die huis te bly in plaas daarvan om uit te waag, ten spyte van die nuutgevonde geleenthede.
As 'n volwassene het min dinge my so geïrriteer soos mense wat 'n vervullende lewe gelyk gestel het aan voortdurend uitgaan. Tot vandag toe is daar nêrens anders waar ek eerder sal wees as by die huis nie, wat mettertyd verander het in nie net 'n plek van gemak nie, maar ook my werkplek. Ten spyte van die uitdagings wat meegebring is deur die onregverdige regering-opgelegde inperkings en indringende maatreëls tydens die Covid-pandemie, het dit ook onvoorsiene voordele ingehou. Een hiervan is die oplewing in afstandwerk en afstandsonderrig.
Baie ander het begin om die huis te waardeer as 'n primêre ruimte vir beide werk en opvoeding. Dit bevestig my besluit om 'n ander pad te volg wanneer dit by my kinders se opvoeding kom.

7.3. Die gesinsomgewing.
Voordat tradisionele skole wydverspreid geraak het, het gesinne die rol van onderwys gespeel. Die meeste gesinne het saam in een gebied gewoon, met grootouers, ouers, tantes, ooms en ander familielede. Dit het 'n ondersteunende omgewing geskep waar kinders versorg is terwyl volwassenes gewerk het, en hulle praktiese vaardighede by familielede geleer het.
In ’n gesinshuis word almal in die kind se sukses belê, anders as in openbare of private skole waar die fokus op finansiële gewin kan wees. Terwyl sommige kan redeneer dat salaris 'n belangrike motiveerder vir onderwysers is, sluit die voordele van tuisonderrig die versterking van gesinswaardes in.
Tuisonderrig kan uitdagend wees vir enkelouers of paartjies met werksverpligtinge, aangesien dit dalk vereis dat iemand gehuur word om na die kind te sorg en tuisonderrig te verskaf. Dit kan duur wees en strook dalk nie met die doel om gesinswaardes te vestig nie. As ouers egter van die huis af werk, word tuisonderrig meer haalbaar en om 'n ouer teenwoordig te hê, bied 'n gevoel van sekuriteit. In my geval, om my ouma, tantes en myself in die huis te hê, versprei die werklading en maak dit moontlik dat 'n verskeidenheid vaardighede gedeel kan word.
Ek het die sukses van my ma in die grootmaak van seuns en 'n man gesien, en haar kundigheid is vir my van onskatbare waarde. Net so spreek my ma se prestasiegeskiedenis met die grootmaak van vroue vanself
Om naby familie te woon is belangrik sodat daar altyd ondersteuning beskikbaar is. Volgens my ervaring was familie betroubaar en behulpsaam in tye van nood. Dit verminder ook die hartseer van afskeid met neefs en verseker dat my seun 'n sterk verbintenis met sy uitgebreide familie het.
As die eersgeborene en enigste man voel ek 'n plig om my pa op te volg en vir my ma en broers en susters te sorg. Ten spyte van die feit dat skool my geleer het dat dit verouderd is, glo ek in die belangrikheid van gesinswaardes op grond van my eie ervarings. Deur my gesin bymekaar te hou en 'n gunstige omgewing vir tuisonderrig te bied, het ek die wysheid van my ma behou en 'n huis geskep waar my seun kan leer.

7.4. Beter as daar meer as een kind is.
In my ervaring het ek opgemerk dat daar geen plaasvervanger is vir kinders wat interaksie het en van hul maats leer nie. Formele skole bied kinders die geleentheid om te sosialiseer, mee te ding en van mekaar te leer. As ek my enigste kind sou tuisonderrig, sou ek dalk uitdagings in die gesig staar aangesien hy nie dieselfde interaksie met sy maats sou hê nie.
Ek is egter dankbaar dat hy omring is deur sy neefs wat in dieselfde ouderdomsgroep is. Hulle hou mekaar geselskap en raak nooit verveeld of onrustig by die huis nie. Hulle help mekaar selfs om moeilike konsepte op 'n prettige en samewerkende manier aan te leer. Dit is ongelooflik om te sien hoe vinnig Milande se rekenaarvaardighede verbeter, tot die punt waar hy nou ander met hul rekenaarprobleme help.
Om 'n tiener in die mengelmoes te hê, is ook voordelig, aangesien hy die lesse wat ons hom geleer het aan sy neefs en suster oordra. Onder hulle vind my jongste nefie die meeste baat daarby om ouer kinders te hê om mee te speel en hom te lei. Die multi-generasie en multi-ouer opset help ook met dissipline. Soms, maak nie saak hoe ferm ek met my seun probeer wees nie, ek kan sy sjarme nie weerstaan nie en gee uiteindelik in. Gelukkig, wanneer ouma "nee" sê, maak dit nie saak dat ek ingegee het nie. Net so, wanneer my seun is ongelukkig met my, daar is altyd iemand in die familie wat sy moed ophef, of dit nou een van sy tantes, neefs of sy ouma is.
Deel 3: Hoe ons dit laat werk.

Hardeware en sagteware vereistes.

Een van die min voordele van die formele skoolstelsel is dat dit na al die logistieke kwessies omsien, dus hoef ouers nie daaroor bekommerd te wees nie. Ouers kan vermy om betrokke te wees by hul kind se opvoeding, veral as die skool nie baie goed is nie. Skole moet alle kinders aanvaar, selfs in aktiwiteite waaraan ouers moet deelneem. Hulle kan nie 'n kind uitsit om hul deelname te dwing nie.
Ouers met kinders in die formele skoolstelsel hoef gewoonlik net seker te maak hul kind gaan skool toe. Hulle kan kies om min betrokkenheid te hê by hoe die skool werk. Die regering beheer nou formele onderwys, wat anders is as die verlede toe skole deur gemeenskapslede geskep is.
Tuisonderrig is baie betrokke. Jy moet by alles betrokke wees!
Al lyk tuisonderrig aanvanklik veeleisend, bied dit baie geleenthede om geld te spaar, want dit strook met gereelde huishoudelike en gesinsaktiwiteite. Die lessenaar wat vir skoolwerk aan die einde van 'n gewone skooldag gebruik word, werk net so goed vir tuisonderrig, as dit selfs nodig is.
Op die ou end werk tuisonderrig en die huishoudelike omgewing goed saam en bevoordeel beide ouers en kinders. Soms is dit nuttig, en selfs nodig, om hulp van iemand anders te kry, maar die meeste dinge is die gesin se verantwoordelikheid. Dit kan die gesin belangrike lesse en nuwe vaardighede leer.

8.1 Tuisklaskamervereistes.
Om 'n toegewyde lessenaar te hê is belangrik vir 'n produktiewe tuisklaskamer. Jy moet 'n stoel en lessenaar hê wat goeie postuur ondersteun en gemaklike sit moontlik maak. Voldoende berging vir boeke en papiere is noodsaaklik om jou huis georganiseer te hou. Goeie beligting en ventilasie is ook belangrik. Alhoewel 'n rekenaar gerieflik is, is dit nie nodig nie, aangesien leermateriaal in fisiese kopieë gekoop kan word en aanlynbronne op verskillende maniere verkry kan word.

8.2. Hardewarevereistes.
Ek het besluit om elke kind van 'n rekenaar te voorsien om hul leer sowel aanlyn as vanlyn te vergemaklik. Elke kind moet ten minste 'n rekenaar hê wat aan die internet kan koppel. Modems en routers is nodig om die internetverbinding en Wi-Fi-sein te vestig. Daarbenewens verseker 'n drukker, selfs 'n monochrome een, dat hardekopiewerkboeke geproduseer kan word.
Alhoewel die aankoop van fisiese kurrikulum en leermateriaal rekenaargebruik kan verminder, is dit steeds van kardinale belang om toegang tot die nuutste aanlyn hulpbronne te hê. Ek glo persoonlik in 'n hibriede benadering wat vanlyn en aanlyn leer kombineer. Ons berei immers die kinders voor vir die toekoms, en rekenaarvaardighede is noodsaaklik. Ek onthou die eerste keer toe ek aan 'n rekenaar geraak het toe ek 17 jaar oud was, tydens my eerste jaar van tersiêre opleiding!
Deesdae is daar baie opsies om van te kies wanneer dit kom by die aankoop van rekenaars, wat wissel van slimfone en tablette tot skootrekenaars, Chromebooks en rekenaars. Elke toestel het sy eie hardeware en vormfaktor, wat lei tot verskille in sagtewarefunksionaliteit. Daarom is sommige toestelle meer geskik vir aanlynleerdoeleindes as ander.
Alhoewel slimfone en tablette produktief kan wees, is hulle hoofsaaklik ontwerp vir mediaverbruik en vermaak. Hul kleiner grootte en gebrek aan fisiese sleutelborde maak hulle minder ideaal vir daaglikse rekenaarbetrokkenheid. Dit is egter aanvaarbaar om 'n slimfoon of tablet te gebruik om toegang tot aanlyn verwysingsbronne te verkry, met tablette wat verkieslik is weens hul groter grootte. Dit is egter belangrik om oormatige gebruik van hierdie toestelle vir lang tydperke te vermy. Om vir 'n lang tyd na 'n klein skerm te staar, kan die oë strem, om nie eens te praat van die ongerief om op 'n klein sleutelbord te tik nie.
Skootrekenaars, Chromebooks en MacBooks is uitstekende opsies, veral vir diegene met beperkte spasie of wat gereeld reis. Hulle laat studente toe om te leer waar hulle ook al is, selfs buite hul huise. Skootrekenaars bied 'n wye verskeidenheid keuses, van bekostigbare opsies wat goed presteer tot hoë-end modelle. Hulle word wyd deur groot maatskappye gebruik, wat verseker dat daar genoeg verskaffers beskikbaar is vir herstelwerk en dienste. Boonop is die gebruikte mark vir skootrekenaars omvangryk, aangesien baie maatskappye hul toestelle opgradeer nadat dit afgeskryf is. Opgeknapte skootrekenaars is dikwels in 'n goeie toestand en kan by gespesialiseerde verskaffers gekoop word.
Een voordeel van skootrekenaars is hul vermoë om aan te hou werk tydens kragonderbrekings, wat veral relevant is in Suid-Afrika met gereelde beurtkrag. Skootrekenaars kan egter duurder wees as tafelrekenaars en is nie so maklik opgradeerbaar nie. Hul oordraagbaarheid maak hulle ook meer kwesbaar vir skade of diefstal, veral wanneer hulle met openbare vervoer pendel.
Chromebooks, wat 'n liggewig bedryfstelsel het wat op die Chrome-blaaier gebaseer is, is die moeite werd om te oorweeg. Hulle is relatief vinnig sonder om hoë-end hardeware te benodig. Alhoewel hulle vroeër gekritiseer is vir beperkte berging, het die meeste toepassings nou aanlyn weergawes wat die kritiek irrelevant maak. As bykomende geheue benodig word, kan eksterne hardeskywe of ander draagbare bergingstoestelle gebruik word. Daar is egter nie veel verskeidenheid Chromebooks plaaslik beskikbaar nie, so om dit in te voer wanneer die wisselkoers gunstig is, kan 'n goeie opsie wees.
Desktops is my voorkeurkeuse vanweë hul laer koste in vergelyking met skootrekenaars met soortgelyke spesifikasies en hul gemak van opgradeerbaarheid. Solank dit nie mini- of kleinfaktor-rekenaars is nie, bied gemiddelde rekenaarhouers genoeg ruimte vir opgraderings, en die meeste gevalle laat toe vir gereedskapvrye toegang. Die vaste aard van 'n lessenaar strook ook met 'n toegewyde ruimte vir onderrig en leer by die huis. Dit help om huisreëls af te dwing en verseker dat kinders die nodige pouses van skerms neem en afleidingsvrye etenstye het.
Werkskerms kan egter lywig en nie prakties wees in ruimtes waar spasie beperk is nie. Alhoewel mini-rekenaars beskikbaar is, benadeel hul klein grootte dikwels opgradeerbaarheid. Die Raspberry Pi is 'n uitsondering, want dit is relatief klein, maar tog hoogs aanpasbaar. Die gebrek aan 'n interne battery, wat skootrekenaars het, kan vergoed word deur 'n ononderbroke kragtoevoer te gebruik.
Om 'n rekenaar te deel tussen verskeie mense wat op dieselfde tyd werk, is moontlik met die regte hardeware of sagteware. Met die Aster Multiseat-sagteware kan een rekenaar verskeie mense bedien met net die byvoeging van randapparatuur. Een nadeel van gedeelde rekenaars is dat as een kind nie die rekenaar gebruik nie, dit nie individueel afgeskakel kan word nie, aangesien dit vir beide gebruikers gelyktydig afskakel. Die kind wat nie die rekenaar gebruik nie, moet uitteken.


Die Kurrikulum.

My visie vir my kinders se opvoeding het altyd 'n risikogebaseerde benadering behels, maar dit was eers met die COVID-inperkings dat ek beslissend opgetree het. Binne drie maande het ons die bewuste keuse gemaak om aanlyn skoolopleiding te aanvaar, wetende dat ons die nodige hulpbronne het om hierdie nuwe onderneming te ondersteun.
Aanvanklik het ek die grense tussen tuisonderrig en die bywoning van 'n aanlyn skool van die huis af vervaag. Ek kon nie die eiesoortige aard van tuisonderrig ten volle begryp nie, en het nagelaat om die kurrikulum en die lewering daarvan in ag te neem. My kniehalter reaksie was om 'n afstandsonderrigmodel aan te neem, met iemand anders wat die kurrikulum verskaf.
Alhoewel dit nie ware tuisonderrig was nie, het hierdie benadering die oorgang baie vergemaklik. Dit het ons toegelaat om te bepaal of tuisonderrig geskik is vir my nefie, wat voorheen openbare skole bygewoon het en in graad vyf was. Dit was noodsaaklik dat die oorgang geleidelik moes plaasvind. Deur 'n standaardkurrikulum te volg, gestruktureerde aanlynklasse by te woon en toegewyde onderwysers te hê, kon ons vasstel of tuisonderrig die regte pas vir hom was.

9.1. Beskikbare kurrikulums.
Aanlynonderrig in Suid-Afrika bied dieselfde komponente as formele skoolopleiding maar met die buigsaamheid om van die huis af te leer. Daar is drie kurrikulumopsies beskikbaar: Kurrikulumassesseringsbeleidsverklarings (KABV) wat in openbare skole gebruik word, Onafhanklike Eksamenraad (IEB) vir privaatskole, en Cambridge Assessment International Education.
Daar is diensverskaffers wat die volledige tuisskoolstel met al die nodige materiaal verkoop om 'n ouer en die leerder te help. Hierdie pakkette wissel van vyfduisend tot minder as tienduisend rand in een-en-twintig. Om aanlyn skoolopleiding te kies, bied 'n hoë-gehalte onderwys teen 'n meer bekostigbare koste in vergelyking met gesogte privaatskole.

9.2. Tuisonderrig.
Om tuisonderrig te optimaliseer, integreer onderwys in 'n kind se roetine en fokus op die ontwikkeling van relevante vaardighede in plaas daarvan om net 'n vasgestelde kurrikulum te volg. Ons lesse sinchroniseer nou met ons gesin se aktiwiteite en wat in die wêreld gebeur.
My nefie se klasse het meer soos navorsingsessies geword eerder as lewendige lesings. Hy leer deur aktief dinge te doen, soos om modelle te ontwerp en te bou om hoeke te verstaan. Hy leer ook IT-vaardighede, beide hardeware en sagteware, deur praktiese ervarings.
Tuisonderrig was 'n wonderlike ervaring vir my, my ma en my susters. Ons leer en verfris voortdurend ons kennis as onderwysers, en ons geniet dit. Die kinders se entoesiasme vir leer het ook ander volwassenes in die huis geïnspireer.
Sedert een-en-twintig kweek ons ons eie groente in my ma se tuin, wat 'n belangrike bron van vars produkte geword het. Die kinders neem aktief deel aan tuinmaak, wat nie net hul liggame voed nie, maar ook hul verstand verryk. Die gehalte van ons kos het verbeter, en dit het selfs 'n belangstelling in kosmaak vir my nefie en die jonger kinders gewek.
Voorheen het ons ander gehuur om die meeste van die bou- en instandhoudingswerk vir ons huis te doen. Maar nou het ons 'n werkswinkel vir skrynwerk, sweiswerk, loodgieterswerk, en meer. Soos ons by hierdie aktiwiteite betrokke raak, brei ons kennis en vaardighede uit. Gelukkig is daar baie gratis aanlynbronne beskikbaar om kennis op te doen as jy bereid is om die moeite te doen om navorsing te doen.
Aanlyn hulpbronne.
Mense fokus dikwels op die verkryging van kwalifikasies van die skoolstelsel om meer kundig te word, wat lei tot 'n fokus op die verkryging van kwalifikasies eerder as om kennis op te doen. Dit het gelei tot 'n toename in hooggeplaaste staatsamptenare en politici wat hul kwalifikasies fabriseer, wat deur die samelewing versprei het as gevolg van morele verval.
Die struktuur van formele skoolopleiding lei soms daartoe dat individue dit probeer vermy. Kinders wat voorgee dat hulle siek is om skool oor te slaan, is niks nuuts nie. Maar hoekom probeer ons so hard om iets te vermy wat ons help om te leer en baie voordele inhou?
Die realiteit is dat die kennis wat ons op skool opdoen dikwels nie vir baie lank by ons bly nie. Daar is baie video's op sosiale media waar mense sukkel om basiese kennis te herroep wat hulle op skool geleer het, selfs net 'n jaar later. 'n Artikel het aan die lig gebring dat slegs 55 persent van onderwysers op 'n graad vierde vlak kan presteer. Onderwysers, wat deur dieselfde klasse gegaan het wat hulle onderrig, sukkel om te onthou wat hulle geleer het.
As onderwysers nie kan onthou wat hulle geleer het nie, stel jou voor hoeveel moeiliker dit is vir individue wat trigonometrie op hoërskool gestudeer het, maar dit in tien jaar nie gebruik het nie. Vir baie onderwysers, as hulle eers die nodige kwalifikasies en werk het, is daar geen motivering vir hulle om kundig in hul vakke te bly nie. Hulle hoef nie bekommerd te wees dat hul studente se prestasie tydens evaluasies oor hulle reflekteer nie, want die proses is vlak. Daar is lae standaarde vir studente om na die volgende graad te slaag. Hierdie beleide ontmoedig studente wat druip en skep 'n gebrek aan motivering vir onderwysers om bekwaam te wees.

10.1 Gratis en laekoste aanlyn hulpbronne.
'n Mens kan gratis onderwys by gesogte instellings en professionele persone deur die internet bekom. Baie hoogaangeskrewe instellings wêreldwyd bied gratis inhoud en toegang tot professionele persone deur sosiale media. Daar is talle webwerwe, toepassings en hulpbronne van onderwysinstellings, wins- en niewinsorganisasies en regeringswebwerwe wat gratis leermateriaal verskaf.
Akademiese soekenjins en basiese soekenjins soos Google Scholar en Google bied navorsingsvraestelle gratis aan. Videodeelwerwe soos YouTube en opvoedkundige televisiekanale bied ook gratis opvoedkundige inhoud. Daarbenewens bied baie aanlyn-leerplatforms hulpbronne vir alle ouderdomme, waarvan sommige vryelik toeganklik is. Alhoewel hierdie opsies nie voltooiingsertifikate bied nie, bied dit genoeg geleenthede vir kennissoekers.
Van Warmelo-versameling op die Universiteit van Pretoria se webwerf bied gratis toegang tot historiese dokumente oor die inheemse mense van Suid-Afrika. Oorspronklike manuskripte word deur Suid-Afrikaanse Erfenis-uitgewers getranskribeer vir makliker toegang teen minder as R400 per jaar.

10.2 Aanlyn sekuriteit en produktiwiteit gereedskap.
As 'n voldoeningspraktisyn het ek nou saam met kuberveiligheid gewerk en die belangrikheid van aanlynveiligheid geleer. Linux bied die beste waarde vir geld in hierdie verband aangesien dit nie 'n antivirus vereis nie. Windows is egter gewild onder kuberkrakers, so antivirus en aanlynbeskerming is belangrik.
Om aanlyn sekuriteit en produktiwiteit te verseker, gebruik ons sagteware van die eienaars direk of die amptelike toepassingwinkels vir die bedryfstelsel. Linux kom met die meeste sagteware vir blaai, woordverwerking en ander produktiwiteitsagteware, sowel as die toepassingwinkel. Sagteware wat onwettig of van gewetenlose werwe afgelaai word, bevat dikwels bykomende toepassings wat jou rekenaar kan vertraag of virusse en wanware kan installeer.
Dit is noodsaaklik om 'n amptelike bedryfstelsel te gebruik wat vir sekuriteitsopgraderings ondersteun word. Die meeste toestelle het 'n bepaalde tydperk waartydens die vervaardiger hom daartoe verbind om opgedateerde sekuriteitsreëlings te verskaf. Antivirus, firewalls en netwerkbeskerming is nie nodig vir Linux nie, maar dit kom dikwels met ingeboude opsies.
Kindermonitering- en produktiwiteitsagteware soos Microsoft Family en Google Family-link is uitstekende produktiwiteitnutsmiddels om 'n ekstra laag sekuriteit te bied en 'n kind se aanlynaktiwiteite te monitor. Hierdie nutsgoed kan kindspesifieke profiele skep vir ouderdomsgeskikte inhoud, skooltyd opstel en daaglikse/weeklikse/maandelikse vorderingsverslae verskaf.
Om risiko's te beperk, het ons wagwoorde en toegewyde werkstasies opgestel, ekstra uitbreidings geïnstalleer om sosiale media-webwerwe te blokkeer, en 'n toegewyde bedryfstelsel gebruik wat op leer gefokus is. Selfmonitering tussen kinders is ook noodsaaklik, aangesien hulle maklik kan agterkom of iets skort terwyl ons op ons werk gefokus is.

10.3. Opvoedkundige webwerwe.
Opvoedkundige webwerwe en toepassings het toegang tot hulpbronne baie makliker en geriefliker gemaak. In die verlede was biblioteke beperk wat ligging en hulpbronne betref, wat dit vir baie mense, veral dié in landelike gebiede, moeilik gemaak het om toegang tot boeke en ander materiaal te kry. Die internet het dit egter verander deur toeganklikheid tot opvoedkundige hulpbronne te verskaf, ongeag die ligging.
Alhoewel sommige opvoedkundige webwerwe dalk 'n intekenfooi vereis, is baie gratis om te gebruik.
Alhoewel die navigasie van die groot hoeveelheid inligting op die internet oorweldigend kan wees, bied betaalde opvoedkundige webwerwe die voordeel om inligting te organiseer en te groepeer vir maklike navigasie. Dit is veral voordelig vir tuisskolers aangesien die webwerwe gestruktureer is op grond van vak, graadvlak en ouderdomsgroep. Daarenteen het gratis webwerwe dikwels afleidings en advertensies wat onvanpas vir kinders kan wees, wat 'n sekuriteitsrisiko inhou.
Een hoogs aanbevole opvoedkundige webwerf is education.com. Terwyl hulle 'n gratis weergawe bied, bied die betaalde intekening 'n wye verskeidenheid hulpbronne soos werkkaarte, speletjies en lesplanne. Dit maak voorsiening vir studente van Pre-K tot graad 8 en maak voorsiening vir die skep van veelvuldige profiele vir elke kind. Die webwerf het ook 'n klaskamermodus vir tot 35 studente, wat dit ideaal maak vir tuisonderriggesinne. Aktiwiteite kan individueel of as 'n groep toegewys word, en vordering kan maklik opgespoor word. Die webwerf is gebruikersvriendelik op beide mobiele toestelle en rekenaars/skootrekenaars.
education.com het 'n eenvoudige koppelvlak en die vermoë om aktiwiteite vooraf te skeduleer, wat maklike beplanning en toesig moontlik maak. Boonop kan familielede as studente bygevoeg word om toesig te hou, inhoud te hersien en vordering te monitor. Hierdie samewerking verseker dat die aangewese materiaal ouderdomsgepas is en strook met die gesin se waardes.

10.4 Webwerwe vs mobiele toepassings.
Aanlyn hulpbronne, webwerwe en mobiele toepassings bied die voordeel van gereeld bygewerkte inligting, anders as harde kopieë. Alhoewel beide platforms soortgelyke inligting verskaf, benodig webwerwe 'n regstreekse internetverbinding, wat toegang tot voorheen afgelaaide inhoud beperk. Aan die ander kant bied mobiele toepassings vanlyn toegang en die buigsaamheid om gewenste inhoud af te laai, ongeag 'n stabiele internetverbinding. Tog kan hulle beperk word deur klein skermgrootte en toestelgeheue.
Oorbrug die sosialiseringsgaping en groepsport.

Ek is agterdogtig oor enigiets wat verpligtend gemaak word, dieselfde geld vir sport- of groepaktiwiteite wanneer dit vereis word. Ek dink daar is te veel klem op sport, ten spyte van die feit dat baie min mense ’n loopbaan daaruit kan maak. Ek het nie gehou van hoe atlete beloon is met medaljes vir die beoefening van sport nie, wat dit laat lyk of onderwys minder belangrik is.
Ek het egter die erkenning van akademiese uitnemendheid op hoërskool geniet, wat kontantpryse ingesluit het. Ek moes baie fisieke werk by die huis doen, so ek het nie die behoefte gesien om soveel tyd aan sport af te staan nie. Die enigste aktiwiteit wat ek wou doen, was gevegskuns, maar daar was geen opsies waar ek gewoon het nie. Gelukkig het my kinders toegang tot baie aktiwiteite en geleenthede deur privaat verskaffers en tuisonderriggroepe.
Ons kan selfs ons eie groep begin indien nodig. Tuisonderrig gaan daaroor om ons kinders te leer om leiers en skeppers te wees.

11.1. Interaksie met ander kinders.
Baie mense is bekommerd dat tuisonderrig kan lei tot 'n gebrek aan interaksie met ander kinders, wat 'n kind se sosiale vaardighede kan beïnvloed. Dit was egter nog nooit vir my 'n bekommernis nie, want ek het ander kinders in die huis. Ek verstaan dat as ek net een kind tuisonderrig het, dit 'n probleem kan wees. Maar in ons geval is my susters en ma baie sosiaal en neem die kinders dikwels na parke, geleenthede en ander plekke waar hulle ander kinders kan ontmoet.
In ons area is die Rietvlei Dieretuinplaas 'n wonderlike plek vir kuier en buitemuurse aktiwiteite. Hulle het roetes, piekniekplekke, swem, sokker en visvang. My huis word ook gereeld besoek deur my kind se vriende wat vir kuier en oorslaap kom. Boonop het my nefie meer besoeke van sy vriende vir speletjiesaande en uitgaan as wat ek ooit gedoen het toe ek skool toe gegaan het. Hulle hou selfs aanlyn kontak en gesels terwyl hulle videospeletjies speel.
Dus, hoewel sommige dalk bekommerd is oor sosialisering, is daar baie maniere om hierdie bekommernis aan te spreek. Om in 'n uitgebreide gesin te woon het sy voordele, veral vir die kinders. Hulle het broers en susters om hulle geselskap te hou en volwassenes wat hulle ondersteun om hul verskillende belangstellings en aktiwiteite na te streef.
Deel 4: Die nie so goed nie en die groot.
Probleme tot dusver.

Een van my mees lewendige herinneringe is my daaglikse skoolroetine tydens laerskool. Dit het die opsê van gebede, die nakoming van reëls en deelname aan buitemuurse aktiwiteite ingesluit. Hierdie roetine het voortgeduur deur my formele opleiding, waar daar gevolge was om nie te voldoen nie. Hierdie opvoeding het my goed voorberei vir my eerste werk in terme van stiptelikheid, respek vir gesag en navolging van reëls. Ten spyte van sy onvolmaakthede, het die formele skoolstelsel effektief roetine geleer.

12.1. Afdwinging van voldoening aan skedules by die huis.
Tuisonderrig spreek sommige tekortkominge van die formele skoolstelsel aan, maar dit ontbreek ook in onderrigkonformiteit met roetines. Daar is geen vaste skedules of vroeë opstaan tye nie.
My kinders word aangemoedig om vrae te vra en vir hulself te dink, selfs al is dit in stryd met wat volwassenes doen. Ek gee nie punte of besige werk nie, eerder assesseer ek hul leervordering deur projekte en vakvaardigheid.
Terwyl dissipline soms buitensporig in formele skole is, is roetines belangrik om afgeronde volwassenes te word. Daar is verskeie tydsensitiewe aktiwiteite by die huis wat nakoming van skedules bevorder. Solo het byvoorbeeld take opgedra soos om die honde kos te gee en die vullis uit te haal.
Selfs die jongste kinders is bewus van hierdie roetines. Tuisonderrig maak egter voorsiening vir buigsaamheid en daar is alternatiewe maniere om dissipline in te bring sonder harde skedules en militêre stylafdwinging.

12.2 Toepassing van Dissipline.
Ouerskap kan ons kwesbaar maak vir ons kinders se emosies. Selfs as my seun ouer word, raak sy sjarme my steeds, wat dit moeilik maak om hom te dissiplineer.
Dit is anders met sy ouma en tantes wat nie maklik geswaai word nie. Hulle het meer invloed en kan hom laat gehoorsaam. My susters het ook ’n impak op hom. Wanneer hy nie wil gaan slaap nie, roep ek ’n tannie om hom te oortuig. Die kinders in my uitgebreide familie help ook om mekaar in lyn te hou en moeilikheid te vermy.
Hierdie omgewing was goed vir dissipline en leer, aangesien ons nie buite-owerhede nodig het nie. Ons loop nie die risiko van streng straf in die gesig nie, want ons almal gee om vir die kind se welstand. Ongelukkig kan kinderoppassers of onderwysers in ander gevalle te ver gaan om kinders te dissiplineer. Maar in my huishouding het ons ondersteuning van ander volwassenes, so niemand voel oorweldig nie en daar is altyd iemand om in te gryp as dit nodig is.
Voordele tot op datum.
Om die vrees te oorkom om van die norm af te wyk, was my grootste uitdaging. Die rigiede struktuur van formele skoolopleiding, gevolg deur die roetines om 'n werknemer in die formele sektor te wees, het my hele bestaan bepaal. Ten spyte van die geleidelike poging om 'n lewe te bou wat tuisonderrig moontlik sou maak, sou dit langer geneem het om te implementeer sonder 'n katalisator.
Een sleuteldruk na tuisonderrig het gekom toe my gesin in ons huidige huis ingetrek het. My nefie en sy ouma het van die Oos-Kaap na Johannesburg verhuis en in 'n eiendom wat ek besit het, net 10 minute van hul huidige huis gebly. Aangesien Ridgeway nader aan Winchester Ridge-laerskool was, was dit die skool wat hy aanvanklik bygewoon het. Ten spyte van my suster se pogings om toelating in 'n skool binne loopafstand van ons nuut gekonsolideerde gesinskoshuis te verseker, was haar pogings tevergeefs.
Dit het die volgende jaar gebeur, teen watter tyd die COVID-inperkings op die horison was. Ek kan steeds nie begryp hoe iemand wat nêrens naby die skool bly nie, voorkeur gegee kan word, veral as in ag geneem word dat my eiendomsbelasting tot die skool bydra.
Die voordeel van die onredelike COVID-inperkings is dat dit my gehelp het om my gedagtes vinniger te maak, en sedertdien het ek nog nooit teruggekyk nie.

13.1. Koste.
Die vergelyking van die vaste koste verbonde aan formele skoolopleiding met die aanlyn/tuisskool-opsie het aan die lig gebring dat die aankoop van die volledige pakket, insluitend aanlynklasse en alle leermateriaal, goedkoper geblyk het te wees as die koste van vervoer alleen. Al was die aanvanklike koste om 'n studie by die huis op te rig hoog, was dit laer as die jaarlikse uitgawes van die mees bekostigbare openbare skool in die area vir alle kinders.

13.2. Kweek gesinswaardes.
Ek respekteer my ouers, wat die onderwysstelsel se oortuigings oor die ideale gesin en rykdom uitgedaag het. Ten spyte daarvan dat hulle nie materieel ryk was nie, was hulle toewyding om my en my broers en susters groot te maak, meer werd as materiële rykdom.
Ek het baie mense uit ryk gesinne sien sukkel, terwyl my ouers se waardes deurslaggewend in my lewe was. Hulle het my harde werk, verantwoordelikheid en die belangrikheid van gesin geleer, anders as wat ek op skool geleer het. Danksy hulle sien ek deur misleidende agendas wat in die onderwys afgedwing word.
Die formele onderwysstelsel het my nie veel voorsien in vergelyking met my ouers nie, en die mislukkings daarvan is duidelik in die hoë werkloosheidsyfer ten spyte van meer mense wat skool bywoon.

13.3. Gesonde voeding en eetgewoontes.
Die verbetering van die vermoë van kinders om te leer deur wanvoeding te bekamp, honger te verminder en skoolbywoning te verbeter, was 'n kritieke aspek van ons tuisonderrigprogram, wat 'n fokus op gesonde voeding en eetgewoontes verseker.
Ten slotte, hoewel ek dankbaar is vir die sukses wat deur die formele skoolstelsel behaal is, is die realiteit dat ek die meeste van die boustene gehad het wat nodig was om die meeste van die bietjie onderwys wat die skoolstelsel verskaf het, te benut. Die bewyse ondersteun oorweldigend die nadelige gevolge van die uitrol van 'n gestandaardiseerde kurrikulum, en dit is duidelik dat die voordele van tuisonderrig ver swaarder weeg as die uitdagings.

13.4. Buigsame tye wat voorkom dat jy te vroeg wakker word.
Navorsing het getoon dat dit nie goed is vir kinders om baie vroeg vir skool op te staan nie. Kinders van 3-5 jaar het 13 uur slaap nodig, 6-12-jariges benodig 9-12 uur en tieners het 8-10 uur nodig.
Gebrek aan slaap kan lei tot gesondheidsprobleme soos hartsiektes, hoë bloeddruk en beroertes. Dit kan ook vetsug en geheueprobleme veroorsaak. Gebrek aan slaap beïnvloed leer, gedrag en algemene gesondheid by kinders. Vroeë skoolbegintye word geassosieer met groter dissiplinêre kwessies en laer toetstellings by jonger studente.
Vir adolessente maak vroeë begintye dit vir hulle moeilik om genoeg slaap te kry en kan dit lei tot swakker prestasie op skool. Tuisonderrig bied meer buigsaamheid en maak voorsiening vir meer gesinstyd. Dit bevoordeel ook ouers se slaapskedules, veral in gebiede met swaar verkeer of wanneer die werkplek ver van die huis af is.

13.5. Verminderde reis.
In November 2022 het 'n artikel in die Financial Mail bevraagteken waarom Suid-Afrika die ergste sterftesyfers het. Tussen Januarie en Maart 2023 is 2498 lewens op Suid-Afrikaanse paaie verloor. Baie mense, insluitend kinders, is in gevaar weens die lang afstande wat hulle moet aflê om by die werk of skool te kom.
Baie landelike skole het gesluit, wat kinders met geen formele skoolopsies naby hul huise gelaat het nie. Die sluiting van hierdie skole is te wyte aan 'n lae aantal studente aangesien baie jongmense na die stede verhuis. Gevolglik moet kinders langer afstande stap, wat die risiko van ongelukke verhoog.
Boonop lei oorvol en swak gehalte openbare skole in stedelike gebiede daartoe dat kinders onveilige vervoer gebruik. Voorvalle van oorvol en onpadwaardige minibustaxi's is aangemeld, wat kinders aan verdere risiko's blootgestel het. Verder is daar 'n verhoogde risiko dat kinders slagoffers van mensehandel en ontvoering word.
Hierdie risiko's is 'n bekommernis vir ouers, veral wanneer hulle staatmaak op onveilige vervoer vir hul kinders. Gelukkig verlig enige opsie anders as die huidige rigiede skoolstelsel dit met tuisonderrig wat die beste alternatief is. Om nie gereeld te reis nie, verminder die risiko om 'n motorongeluk te hê.
Deel 5: Informele kennis, ongeartikuleerde wysheid en familiediversiteit

Die gevaar om formele skoolopleiding gelyk te stel met onderrig en kwalifikasies vir kennis.
In my familie het my pa, met sy na-matrieksertifikaat, waardevolle werk in Transkei op die platteland verkry, en die behoefte om in die myne te werk, soos baie ander, omseil. My ma, sonder 'n formele kwalifikasie, kan volgens konvensionele standaarde as onopgevoed beskou word. Ten spyte daarvan dat ek die regskool drie krediete kort van my LLB-graad verlaat het, het ek meer akademies bereik as enigiemand anders in my gesin. Ek het talle gespesialiseerde kursusse voltooi, met 'n Nasionale Diploma en 'n Baccalaureusgraad in Tegnologie.
Voorheen het ek formele, geartikuleerde kennis bo informele ervaring geprioritiseer. Ek het geglo ek moet 'n sekere loopbaanstatus bereik voordat ek 'n kind kry om die beste vir hulle te voorsien. Dit het daartoe gelei dat ek onvermoeid gewerk het aan finansiële stabiliteit en toegang tot professionele ondersteuning vir my kind se groei en ontwikkeling.

14.1. Ongeartikuleerde kennis en ongekende kundigheid.
Volgens konvensie het my ma se gebrek aan formele kwalifikasies beteken dat sy nie my kind se gesondheid en welstand kon help nie.
Sy sou net liefdevolle ouma wees met geen tasbare bydrae nie. Omdat albei my ouers hul ma's verloor het toe hulle jonk was, het ek gedink dat ek nie die ervaring het om 'n biologiese ouma te hê nie, so ek het gewerk dat my kinders soveel toegang as moontlik tot hul biologiese oumas het.
Ek het nie besef dat haar beste kwalifikasie ook die mees relevante was nie, om haar eie kinders groot te maak. My ma het suksesvol na my nefies en niggie gesorg en bewys dat sy steeds ten volle in staat is om 'n deurslaggewende rol in haar kleinkinders se ontwikkeling en welstand te speel. Ten spyte van die materiële sukses wat ek behaal het, verstaan ek nou dat die konvensionele standaarde van 'die beste' nie weerspieël wat werklik belangrik is nie.

14.2. Geartikuleerde kennis en gekwalifiseerde kundigheid.
Die skrywer se seun, Sazi, is grootgemaak deur sy ma en ouma aan moederskant, later 'n afgetrede gesondheidswerker wat verskeie kwalifikasies het en 'n Meestersgraad is deur sy ma as sy primêre versorger aangewys. Hy het toegang tot verskeie mediese spesialiste en gespesialiseerde sorg deur kinderoppassers gehad, wat hy ten minste vyf oppassers gehad het toe hy 5 jaar oud was.
Anders as sy neefs, wat gereeld babakos en gewone babaprodukte ontvang het, het Sazi se ma net premium produkte voorgeskryf. Hy is toegelaat om sy vaderhuis in April 2019 te besoek, met voorbereide maaltye, dieetinstruksies en 'n toegewyde oppasser. Sy dieet het suikervrye jogurt, druiwe en lae-kalorie ryskoeke ingesluit.
Ten spyte van dit alles het Sazi die eerste jaar 5 weke in die hospitaal deurgebring en is voortgegaan om ten minste een keer per jaar gehospitaliseer te word totdat hy 3 was. Hy is aangeraai om 'n spraakterapeut te sien wanneer hy uitstel om te praat, al het hy geen ander fisiese ontwikkelingsprobleme gehad nie. .
Sazi het meer dokters en spesialiste gesien as alle ander kinders saam, 'n gekwalifiseerde primêre versorger en het tog die slegste gesondheidsuitkomste gehad. Geen ander mans in die gesin het spraakterapie benodig nie, al het ons almal gesloer om te praat.

14.3. Die waarde van persoonlike ervaring bo gekwalifiseerde kundigheid.
My verkeerde oortuiging dat formele onderwys en geloofsbriewe gelykstaande is aan opgevoed word, is verneder deur 'n werklike ervaring. Ten spyte daarvan dat hy meer geld aan Sazi bestee het as ander kinders, was sy uitkomste die slegste.
Toe hy egter meer tyd saam met sy vaderlike familie begin spandeer het, het sy gesondheid en welstand aansienlik verbeter. Sy aantal doktersbesoeke het afgeneem, en hy het minder antibiotika gebruik. Hy eet nou dieselfde kos as almal in die huis en groei goed. Sy lag is nou so gereeld soos die ander kinders.
Toe Sazi 'n allergie gehad het, was dit meer effektief om tyd saam met sy onopgevoede ouma deur te bring as duur intervensies van opgevoede spesialiste. Sy het 'n plant in die tuin gekry wat sy allergie genees het.
Met die uitsondering van my jongste nefie, het elke man in my gesin gesloer om te praat, begin by my. Alhoewel ek as kind 'n vertraagde toespraak gehad het, het ek 'n positiewe impak gehad op die verbetering van die lewenskwaliteit vir my ma, susters en hul kinders. Almal van hulle leef ver bo hul vermoë, en bied ten koste van my 'n goeie lewenskwaliteit en 'n beter omgewing om hul kinders groot te maak.
Die ervarings van Dr Sowell in sy boek "Late-Talking Children" het my oë oopgemaak. Sazi se vermoë om te lees sonder om geleer te word, stem ooreen met die patrone van laat-pratende kinders wat deur Dr. Sowell beskryf word. Sy navorsing is geloofwaardig en herkenbaar.
Ware intelligensie word bepaal deur 'n mens se vermoë om ten minste selfversorgend te wees, en dan voort te gaan om vir geliefdes te voorsien. Ek kon vir myself voorsien sedert ek 18 was met minimale bystand van my ma. My optrede het ook die lewens van my ma en my gesin verbeter. Die lewenskwaliteit vir al ons gesinslede het verbeter, en hulle het 'n ondersteuningstelsel vir die beste en slegste tye.

14.4. Geneesheer, genees jouself.
Gesondheidswerkers prioritiseer dikwels hul eie belange bo die welstand van hul pasiënte. Dit kan tot negatiewe gevolge vir individue en gesinne lei.
Daarteenoor het ouers en familielede ’n persoonlike belang daarin om die beste sorg vir hul geliefdes te verseker. Om professionele persone blindelings te vertrou, kan lei tot verkeerde diagnose of ondoeltreffende behandelings.
Politici en burokrate versuim ook dikwels om hul beloftes na te kom. Familielede, aan die ander kant, belê hul tyd en moeite in die versorging van hul geliefdes. Hulle toewyding bring dikwels groter belonings en vervulling. Staatswerknemers kies dikwels vir private dienste vir hulself en hul gesinne, wat die gebrek aan geloofwaardigheid in hul eie werk beklemtoon.
Persoonlike ondervinding en eerstehandse kennis is meer waardevolle aanwysers van bevoegdheid as formele onderwys. Dit is belangrik om bewerings te bevraagteken en bewyse te soek voordat dit as waarheid aanvaar word.
Tuisonderrig komplementeer ons uiteenlopende gesinstrukture.

Konserwatiewe Suid-Afrikaners ondersteun toenemend die kerngesin as die beste manier om kinders groot te maak, al was uitgebreide gesinne die norm vir die meeste van ons voorvaders. Verslegtende sosio-ekonomiese toestande dwing sommige mense om terug te keer om by hul uitgebreide familie te gaan woon, ten spyte van die huidige neiging van kerngesinne. Die oorsprong van die kerngesin in Suid-Afrika is twyfelagtig, veral vir diegene met landelike agtergronde.

15.1. Die kerngesin se sketsagtige Suid-Afrikaanse oorsprongverhaal.
In die verlede het jong mans van die Transkei-streek hul gesinne verlaat om werk te soek. Hulle het dikwels in swak omstandighede gewoon om geld huis toe te stuur. My oupas het dit gedoen en kon hul gesinne onderhou. Sommige mans het nuwe gesinne begin terwyl hulle weggewerk het. Vroue het dikwels gesukkel wanneer hul mans dit gedoen het. Kinders is soms gestuur om by uitgebreide familie te woon wanneer een of albei van die ouers in 'n kerngesin sterf. Wanneer paartjies probleme ondervind, los hulle hul kinders by familie terwyl hulle dinge uitwerk. Uitgebreide familie is belangrik vir ondersteuning, selfs deur die regering erken.

15.2. Die triomf van die uitgebreide familie.
In 2023 trek baie mense terug huis toe om by die uitgebreide familie te gaan woon weens die swak ekonomie. Terwyl die aantal egskeidings in Suid-Afrika blykbaar in 2020 afgeneem het, het die aantal huwelike ook afgeneem. Daar is dalk nie 'n direkte verband tussen die afname in kerngesinne, die daling in huweliksyfers en die styging in egskeidingsyfers nie.
Die statistieke laat die vraag ontstaan hoe maklik mense in 'n verhouding sal bly sonder 'n wettige huwelikskontrak. Meer as 20% van kinders in Suid-Afrika woon by grootouers of ander familielede, en uitgebreide gesinne is steeds 'n algemene keuse om kinders groot te maak. Dit kan wees as gevolg van die kostebesparings en verminderde afhanklikheid van duur professionele persone in 'n uitgebreide gesinsopset.

15.3. Die uitgebreide familie, een van die beproefde oplossings vir die vroulike huiskrisis.
Huishoudings met vroulike hoof is geneig om armer te wees in vergelyking met ander soorte huishoudings. Dit is wêreldwyd waar, met die armste kategorie wat 'n hoër persentasie van huishoudings met 'n vroulike hoof verteenwoordig sonder 'n man in vergelyking met huishoudings met 'n vroulike hoof met enige huishoudings met 'n manlike of manlike hoof. Suid-Asië het die laagste persentasie huishoudings met 'n vroulike hoof met geen man in die rykste kategorie nie. Huishoudings met vroulike hoof met enige man is geneig om ryker te wees as dié sonder enige man in alle streke, behalwe vir Oos- en Suider-Afrika en Midde-Ooste en Noord-Afrika, waar die verspreiding van rykdom soortgelyk is tussen huishoudings met vroulike hoof met enige man en man. -hoofde huishoudings.
Kinders in huishoudings met 'n vroulike hoof staar nadele in die gesig, veral wanneer daar geen volwasse man teenwoordig is nie. Die teenwoordigheid van 'n manlike figuur, of dit nou 'n pa of oom is, het 'n beduidende impak op die welstand van die huishouding. Uitgebreide gesinsinstellings bied meer ondersteuning en stabiliteit vir kinders in vergelyking met kerngesinne of enkelouerhuishoudings.
Kinders deel ooreenkomste met hul familie, selfs al is hulle aangeneem en grootgemaak apart van hul biologiese familie. Uitgebreide familielede speel 'n deurslaggewende rol in die vorming van 'n kind se identiteit en die verskaffing van belangrike ondersteuning. Die uitgebreide gesinsomgewing dien as 'n beheermaatreël en verminder die waarskynlikheid van mishandeling of verwaarlosing van kinders.
In tye van moeilikheid kan die bekende ondersteuning van uitgebreide familie ouers help om uitdagings te hanteer. Om in 'n uitgebreide gesin grootgemaak te word, bied meer opsies en ondersteuning vir 'n kind in vergelyking met om ver weg te wees van ondersteunende familielede. Om op staatsdienste as die primêre ondersteuning staat te maak, kan dikwels erger wees as om in 'n huishouding met 'n vroulike hoof grootgemaak te word.

15.4. Die kern- en vroulike-hoof huishoudelike model afhanklikheid van eksterne surrogate.
Newsweek het in 1989 bewyse gerapporteer dat om babas vir 20 of meer uur per week in dagsorg te plaas, riskant kan wees as gevolg van hoë omset onder versorgers en hoë siektesyfers. Om hierdie probleme in die openbaar te bespreek, is egter as 'n bekommernis beskou, aangesien sommige gevrees het dat dit gebruik kan word om te argumenteer dat slegs moeders vir babas kan sorg.
Sommige het geglo dat 'n tradisionele gesin steeds die beste manier is om kinders groot te maak en moeders is tuis nodig. Om op spesialiste en eksterne partye staat te maak om kinders te versorg, soos gesien in die kerngesinsopset, word as 'n nadeel beskou.
Hierdie afhanklikheid van eksterne sorg is niks nuuts nie, en die uitgebreide familie het deur die geskiedenis heen gedy ten spyte van moderne alternatiewe. Konserwatiewes het lank gewaarsku daarteen om op eksterne surrogate staat te maak om kinders groot te maak. Daar is geen kwaad daaraan om vroue te prioritiseer en dat die pa en uitgebreide familie kinders by die huis versorg terwyl die vrou haar loopbaan volg nie.

15.5. Tuisonderrig is buigsaam aangesien gesinne uiteenlopend is.
Dit is belangrik om die negatiewe impak van ouerlike skeiding op 'n kind se verhouding met beide ouers en uitgebreide familie te minimaliseer. Meer kinders word in hierdie omstandighede gebore as gevolg van die hoë voorkoms van egskeidings, dalende huweliksyfers en individue wat kies om kinders te hê sonder om in 'n verhouding te wees.
In die verlede het my ouers duidelike rolle in hul verhouding gehad. My ma het by die huis gebly terwyl my pa gewerk het om vir die gesin te voorsien. Hulle het goed saamgewerk omdat hulle verskillende vaardighede en eienskappe gehad het om kinders groot te maak.
Toe my seun se ouers ontmoet het, was ons reeds onafhanklike individue. Ons het nie op mekaar staatgemaak vir praktiese take soos kosmaak en skoonmaak nie. Ons enigste vertroue was op romantiese liefde. Romantiese liefde alleen is egter selde, indien ooit, genoeg om 'n verhouding te onderhou.
Om 'n kind by 'n vaste skool in te skryf kan hul tyd saam met die ander ouer beperk, veral wanneer ouers nie saam is nie. Afstandsonderrig en tuisonderrig bied beter opsies vir kinders in hierdie situasies.
Tuisonderrig maak voorsiening vir buigsaamheid en die geleentheid vir kinders om by familielede te leer. Dit laat vaders ook toe om meer tyd saam met hul kinders deur te bring, aangesien hulle meer buigsame skedules as moeders kan hê in die dag van rasse- en geslagskwatas in die werkplek. Vaders speel 'n belangrike rol om kinders voor te berei vir die lewensuitdagings.
Sport en fisieke aktiwiteit kan voordelig wees vir mans as afsetpunte. Skoolsport het egter minder mededingend geword en fokus meer op veiligheid, wat dalk nie voordelig vir seuns en mans is nie. Moeders prioritiseer dikwels beskerming bo die voorbereiding van hul kinders.
Uitgebreide gesinne is eerliker en hou mekaar verantwoordelik. Dit is belangrik vir beide ouers om eerlik met mekaar te wees om die welstand van hul kind te verseker. Eerlikheid help om die gesin se werklikheid te vorm en maak voorsiening vir beter beplanning.
Dit is belangrik om my seun se ma aanspreeklik te hou en eerlik met haar te wees. Ek bewonder haar ervaring as enigste kind, aangesien my seun ook 'n enigste kind is. Ek voel 'n groot verantwoordelikheid om te verseker dat my seun toegang het tot werklike ervarings en verwantskap.
Oor die algemeen is dit belangrik om die negatiewe impak van ouerlike skeiding te minimaliseer en die welstand van die kind te prioritiseer.
Deel 6: Ter afsluiting, ten minste vir eers.

Tuisonderrig maak sin, selfs vir nie-tuisskolers en die regering.

In Oktober 2023 het Suid-Afrikaners baie gehad om te vier. Ten spyte van die rugbyoorwinning was die mees noemenswaardige rede vir feesviering die ononderbroke kragtoevoer van Eskom, wat 'n aangename afwisseling van die gereelde kragonderbrekings was.
Verkeersvloei het ook verbeter as gevolg van werkende verkeersligte en straatligte. Boonop het mense meer vertroue ervaar dat winkels en dienste voorspelbaar sal funksioneer soos hulle moet. Dit het 'n norm geword dat plekke skielik sluit weens beurtkrag, wat klante gestrand laat. Kosbederf was ook minder kommerwekkend weens 'n vermindering in kragonderbrekings.
Kon die verbeterings veroorsaak word deur die president se aanstelling van 'n minister van elektrisiteit?
Nie eens naby nie!

16.1. Die saak teen sentralisasie, elektrisiteitsvoorsiening as 'n voorbeeld.
Private individue in Suid-Afrika het aksie geneem om hul afhanklikheid van die elektrisiteitsnetwerk te verminder en na alternatiewe energiebronne te wend. Data toon dat huishoudings en besighede 'n aansienlike hoeveelheid sonkrag-PV op die dak geïnstalleer het.
Hierdie verskuiwing in energiebronne is 'n reaksie op gereelde kragonderbrekings wat in die land ervaar word. Die regering se benadering tot elektrisiteitsvoorsiening, met Eskom as 'n monopolie, was 'n probleem om in die toenemende vraag te voorsien. Private individue wat in sonkrag belê, kon egter vir hulself en ander elektrisiteit voorsien.
Dit sou die ideale oplossing gewees het om die koste van die uitrol van elektrisiteit in landelike gebiede te verminder waar huise uitmekaar is en alternatiewe energiebronne soos vuurmaakhout en beesmis algemeen gebruik word. Die regering se beleid en versuim om die behoeftes van landelike inwoners aan te spreek het bygedra tot armoede in landelike gebiede en die daaropvolgende migrasie na stedelike gebiede.
Die installering van sonpanele het gewild geword omdat dit eiendomswaarde verbeter, maar dit is nie moontlik in stamgrond sonder behoorlike eiendomsreg nie. Die huidige verligting van kragonderbrekings is nie te danke aan regeringspogings nie, maar eerder die optrede van privaat individue. Hul beleggings bevoordeel beide hulself en diegene wat nie alternatiewe energiebronne kan bekostig nie.

16.2. Die saak vir tuisonderrig, tot almal se voordeel.
Die formele skoolstelsel het nie sy beloftes nagekom nie, ten spyte van die ontvangs van meer befondsing.
Die aanbied van verskillende onderwysopsies wat deur ouers gekies word, kan druk op die formele skoolstelsel verminder. Dit kan lei tot beter onderwysomstandighede vir diegene wat in formele skole bly. Oorvol klasse het gelei tot groter negatiewe impakte op kinders. Stedelike migrasie en beperkte investering in landelike gebiede dwing kinders om lang afstande skool toe te reis, wat hul lewens in gevaar stel.
Die formele skoolstelsel beperk kreatiwiteit en kritiese denke vir almal. Informele skoolopleiding hou voordele in en moet oorweeg word om die las op kinders en gesinne te verlig. Hierdie benadering sal ouers in staat stel om meer tyd saam met hul kinders deur te bring, en diegene wat formele skoolopleiding verkies, kan beter omstandighede vir leer hê.
