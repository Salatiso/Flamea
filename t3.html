While men's violence can result in more severe injury, women perpetrate physical aggression in intimate relationships at comparable rates.

The Xhosa role of 'indlalifa' (successor) is not a benefit but a profound burden—they inherit family debt and are obligated to care for everyone, while other siblings (including women) are free to leave and build lives elsewhere.

If one argues that all white people must be 'punished' for apartheid, then by the same logic, all black people could be held responsible for the proven corruption, looting, and state regression under the current black-led government.

                explanation: "History is not a simple story of all men oppressing all women. The reality is that a very small elite (mostly men) held power. The average man's life was one of hardship, danger, and sacrifice. Men died in wars, in mines, and on construction sites to provide for their families. They were the disposable gender sent to do the most dangerous work. To ignore these sacrifices and claim all men benefited is a gross and disrespectful distortion of history.",

                explanation: "This is a pervasive modern myth. If schooling were the primary driver of success, all students in the same curriculum would have similar outcomes. But they don't. The data is overwhelming: a stable, supportive home with involved parents is the single greatest predictor of a child's well-being and future success. A child from a strong family will likely succeed despite a bad school, while a child from a broken home will likely struggle despite a good school. The value and ethics instilled by parents, like your uneducated mother raising successful children, is the true 'qualification'.",
